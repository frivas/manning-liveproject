Explanation of the Taxonomy approach. This section sets out the role and importance of sustainable finance in Europe from a policy and investment perspective, the rationale for the development of an EU Taxonomy, the daft regulation and the mandate of the TEG.Methodology. This explains the methodologies for developing technical screening criteria for climate change mitigation objectives, adaptation objectives and ‘do no significant harm’ to other environmental objectives in the legislative proposal. This has been updated since 2019.Full list of technical screening criteria. This annex sets out the sector- and economic activity-specific technical screening criteria and rationale for the TEG’s analysis. These have been updated since 2019.Disclaimer This report represents the overall view of the members of the Technical Expert Group, and although it represents such a consensus, it may not necessarily, on all details, represent the individual views of member institutions or experts. The views reflected in this Report are the views of the experts only. This report does not reflect the views of the European Commission or its services.In the June 2019 report, the TEG explained the process used to assess and select economic activities for inclusion in the Taxonomy. (Shown in Figure 1). The Taxonomy Regulation has not materially changed the TEG’s thinking on methodology for selecting sectors. Further, the TR takes up the TEG’s recommended approach to identify enabling activities as a type of activity.Identifying priorities within the potential universe of economic activities. The universe of economic activities is described using NACE codes. NACE codes cover 21 broad sectors, with four levels of sub-codes. At the fourth level, 615 classes of economic activity are identified.1 Although they may have substantial impacts on other environmental objectives. TEG’s analysis is based on Scope 1 emissions data as Scope 2 and 3 data by NACE code was not available. However, the Taxonomy recognises energy efficiency improvements consistent with the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation. 23 See https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/buildings. Note that emissions from buildings are considered across NACE codes. Emissions from domestic buildings are typically excluded from NACE codes as domestic occupation is not considered an economic activity. Nonetheless, activities to reduce emissions from the residential sector should be considered in the Taxonomy.Where economic activities have the potential to enable substantial GHG emissions reductions in other sectors, these should also be included (assuming the life cycle emissions of the activity do not undermine mitigation objectives).The TEG has identified priority activities within each sector. The name of each macro-sector is drawn directly from the NACE classification system and may refer to activities that were not covered (e.g. the TEG has developed technical screening criteria for agriculture and forestry, but not fishing). Key: Colour codeThis sector was selected because of its emissions profile. The TEG has identified some important economic activities likely to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation in this sector, but further analysis should be undertaken.This sector was selected because it may be able to enable substantive emissions reductions in other sectors. The TEG has identified the main economic activities likely to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation in this sector.This sector was selected because it may be able to enable substantive emissions reductions in other sectors. The TEG has identified some important economic activities likely to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation in this sector, but further analysis should be undertaken.4 For presentation purposes, the TEG has aligned the building criteria with NACE codes for construction and real estate activities. However, the buildings criteria are not limited to these NACE codes and can be applied across other sectors and economic activities. 5 TEG’s methodology was based on Scope 1 emissions, but we recognise that Information and Communication activities may also have substantial Scope 2 emissions. This is reflected in the technical screening criteria for Information and Communications. 6 See note on construction.Developing criteria For each of the activities selected, technical screening criteria have been developed. The format of the technical screening criteria has been updated since the June 2019 report to incorporate:a. Principles: The underlying rationale for how the activity will result in a substantial contribution and/or avoidance of significant harm to the environmental objective in question. b. Criteria: including both metrics and thresholds: The method(s) by which the environmental performance of the economic activity will be measured, including defining the boundary for this measurement and the qualitative or quantitative conditions which must be met to enable the performance of the activity in a way that is considered environmentally sustainable.1a. For the purposes of paragraph 1, an economic activity for which there is no technologically and economically feasible low carbon alternative, shall be considered to contribute substantially to climate change mitigation as it supports the transition to a climate-neutral economy consistent with a pathway to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels including by phasing out greenhouse gas emissions, in particular from solid fossil fuels, where that activity: I. II. III.has greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in the sector or industry; does not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives; and does not lead to a lock-in in carbon-intensive assets considering the economic lifetime of those assets.In addition, the EU has brought forward a proposal for a Climate Law requiring a climate neutral economy by 2050, as well as proposals for interim GHG emissions reductions targets of 50% - 55% by 2030. TEG’s recommendations are aligned with these goals.The following table has been updated since the June 2019 report to show how to consider different types of investment and finance as Taxonomy eligible. The update is to more clearly align with the Taxonomy Regulation which clearly identifies enabling activities, reflecting the TEG recommendation. We now refer to the two activity types as either: An activity which has a substantial contribution due to its own performance – referring to the operations within the activity, reflecting the activity boundary for the technical screening criteria; or an Activity Enabling Mitigation in another economic activity. This table also demonstrates how activities that contribute to transition (Transition Activities in the Taxonomy Regulation) are still expected to substantially contribute to climate mitigation objectives and meet Taxonomy thresholds. This was identified as the third activity type in the June 2019 TEG report.TEG also recommends that the Platform on Sustainable Finance continues the work on inclusion of enabling activities within other sectors in the Taxonomy. Recognition of enabling activities is an important way to encourage research, development, innovation and resulting substantial GHG reductions in economic activities and encourage flows of finance to these activities.7 A minimum of 93%, though the true figure is likely to be higher as buildings do not feature as a separate NACE code and constitute 36% of EU emissions. 8 https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_enThe proposed approach for an adaptation taxonomy recognises that adaptation is context- and locationspecific and requires the use of a process-based approach to determine if an activity contributes to adaptation and broader system’s climate resilience. The following two-step process aims to demonstrate that an activity contributes to a substantial reduction of the negative effects of climate change: a. Assessing the expected negative physical effects of climate change on the underlying economic activity that is the focus of resilience-building efforts, drawing on robust evidence and leveraging appropriate climate information; b. Demonstrating how the economic activity will address the identified negative physical effects of climate change or will prevent an increase or shifting of these negative physical effects. The assessment of the contribution of the activity will vary based on its scope (asset, corporate, sector or market), as well as spatial and temporal scale. Moreover, the proposed approach recognises that an adaptation activity may target an entity (e.g. a corporation or a city) and/or a market, sector, or region. Activity-level adaptation aims at strengthening an asset or economic activity to withstand identified physical climate risks over its lifetime, such as considering sea-level rise in the design of a bridge. Systemic adaptation aims to actively reduce vulnerability and build resilience of a wider system, or systems, such as a community, ecosystem, or city. The TEG recognises that climate change will affect all sectors of an economy and all sectors must adapt to its impacts globally. As a result, the adaptation taxonomy is a set of guiding principles and qualitative screening criteria, which can be applied in any economic activity in any location. It is, therefore, the view of the TEG that these criteria are globally relevant. Differences between climate change adaptation and mitigation The context-specific nature of adaptation means that it is not possible to produce a stand-alone and exhaustive list of activities that could be viewed as contributing to adaptation under all circumstances. Instead of a list of adaptation activities, a set of guiding principles and screening criteria is used to assess the potential contribution of an economic activity to adapt to climate change and increase climate resilience. To aid users of the Taxonomy, the TEG has also developed an indicative framework for classification of climate-related hazards and a climate sensitivity matrix for specific economic activities (see Classification of climate-related hazards and Sectoral climate sensitivity matrices). There are fundamental differences between climate change adaptation activities and mitigation activities. For mitigation activities, a one-tonne reduction of CO2 emissions has the same impact regardless of where the mitigation activity takes place. It is therefore possible to define lists of activities that areInterpreting the regulation in respect of climate change adaptation The proposed regulation establishes a framework for understanding substantial contributions to climate change adaptation objectives. This definition is broadly consistent with that provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.99 The IPCC provides the following definition of adaptation in their 5th Assessment Report: ‘The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects’. IPCC (2014), ‘Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability.

White (eds.), Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA.1.a The adaptation solutions referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 shall be assessed and prioritised using the best available climate projections and shall, as a minimum, prevent or reduce: (a) The location-specific and context-specific adverse impact of climate change on the economic activity; or (b) The adverse impact that climate change may have on the environment within which the economic activity takes placeThe adverse impact of climate change considered for the development of the taxonomy include impact resulting from both chronic or slow onset climate-related hazards (such as average temperature increase and sea level rise) and rapid or acute climate related hazards (such as extreme rainfall, storm surges, flooding, and heat waves). In this report, material physical climate risk is the risk of (financial and non-financial) losses occurring due to performance failures, performance delays or incomplete performance of an economic activity resulting from climate-related hazards. With that in mind, the adaptation taxonomy comprises two types of substantial contribution to adaptation objectives: 1. Adapted activities: an economic activity is adapted to all material physical climate risks identified for the economic activity to the extent possible and on a best effort basis; and/or 2. Activities enabling adaptation of an economic activity: the activity reduces material physical climate risk in other economic activities and/or addresses systemic barriers to adaptation, and is itself also adapted to physical climate risks. Both types of activities must also meet the criteria for Do No Significant Harm to other environmental objectives and comply with minimum social safeguards established for the Taxonomy. Activities adapted to climate change and activities enabling adaptation of other economic activities provide a positive environmental impact by meeting a set of technical criteria for substantial contribution to adaptation and aThis is consistent with the approach taken when identifying economic activities that substantially contribute to climate change mitigation in terms of “mitigated activity” and “activity enabling mitigation”. The first set of economic activities contribute to adaptation via adopting solutions that ensure that the economic activity can perform well under a changing climate. This contribution to adaptation usually occurs in economic activities that have a primary objective other than climate change adaptation. For example, a transmission line for the distribution of electricity to an urban area is made more climate resilient to the expected increase in temperature by installing conductors with operating limits at higher temperature thresholds. Efforts to identify and reduce physical climate risks to an economic activity should be based on a best effort basis, recognising that it is not possible to reduce physical climate risk to zero. The characteristics of risks to an economic activity are increasingly difficult to predict over long timehorizons because of the uncertainties associated with future changes in the climate. As a result, adaptation of an economic activity requires a proportionate, flexible and an iterative risk management approach that can be adjusted over time. The second set of economic activities contribute to adaptation via enabling the adaptation of other economic activities. For example, the construction of a flood protection system is performed to reduce the risk of flood for a facility or a city and the economic activities that take place in it. Similarly, the research,Some of the economic activities currently addressed in the Taxonomy might often fall under the category of ‘adapted activities’, others might be ‘activities enabling adaptation’. There will be activities that can be either type depending on their purpose and the context within which the activity takes place. What is key is the primary objective of the actor engaged in that activity. For this reason, the economic activities are not a priori categorised into ‘Adapted activity’ and/or ‘Activity enabling adaptation’, this is left to the discretion of the user.In the case of an adapted economic activity, the activity integrates measures aimed at reducing all material physical climate risks to that activity as identified through an assessment of risks posed by both current weather variability and expected future climate change. The assessment should take into account chronic and acute climate-related hazards and associated physical climate risks across a range of scenarios, and account for uncertainty. It should consider geographic and temporal scales that are appropriate for the economic activity.In the case of ‘an economic activity enabling adaptation, the activity reduces material risks to other economic activities and/or addresses systemic barriers to adaptation, for example through a dedicated asset, technology, service or product, and itself integrates measures aimed at reducing material risks where applicable (e.g. in the case of a dedicated asset).Economic activities and the measures taken to address the material climate risks facing those activities should be consistent with adaptation needs in the applicable sector or region, considering opportunities to build resilience outside of the premises of a single activity. Those measures should also not increase the risk of an adverse impact on other people, nature and assets in terms of hindering adaptation efforts by others for example by shifting impacts faced by othersWhen possible, the outcomes of adaptation activities should be monitored and measured against defined indicators for adaptation results. If possible, updated assessments of physical climate risks should be undertaken at the appropriate frequency (e.g. every five or ten years) depending on the risks, the context and the availability of new information, technologies or approaches or policies and regulations.2.3 Screening criteria for activities making a substantial contribution to adaptation While the principles describe the foundations and qualities underpinning economic activities that contribute to climate change adaptation, the screening criteria are specific characteristics that can be used to determine whether an economic activity provides a substantial contribution to adaptation. These screening criteria vary between ‘adapted’ activities and activities that enable adaptation. These criteria have been updated since the June 2019 report. Screening criteria for ‘adapted activities’ an economic activity Table 3 Screening criteria for substantial contribution: adapted activitiesThe economic activity integrates physical and non-physical measures aimed at reducing - to the extent possible and on a best effort basis all material physical climate risks to that activity, which have been identified through a risk assessment.The economic activity and its adaptation measures do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts of other people, nature and assets. The economic activity and its adaptation measures do not increase the risks of an adverse climate impact on other people, nature andAdaptation results can be monitored and measured against defined indicators. Recognising that risk evolves over time, updated assessments of physical climate risks should be undertaken at the appropriate frequency where possible.Screening criteria for an activity enabling adaptation The table below describes the screening criteria for economic activities enabling adaptation. Table 4 Screening criteria for substantial contribution: economic activities enabling adaptationThe economic activity reduces material physical climate risk in other economic activities and/or addresses systemic barriers to adaptation. Activities enabling adaptation include, but are not limited to, activities that: a) Promote a technology, product, practice, governance process or innovative uses of existing technologies, products or practices (including those related to natural infrastructure); or, b) Remove information, financial, technological and capacity barriers to adaptation by others. B1.1The economic activity reduces or facilitates adaptation to physical climate risks beyond the boundaries of the activity itself. The activity will need to demonstrate how it supports adaptation of others through:  an assessment of the risks resulting from both current weather variability and future climate change, including uncertainty, that the economic activity will contribute to address based on robust climate data;The TEG recommends that the Platform, as a matter of priority, develops technical guidance on climate risk assessment, use of climate data and information, making decisions under uncertainties and evaluation of different adaptation options to aid the implementation of the taxonomy.In the case of an economic activity enabling adaptation, the revenue and/or expenditure associated with the economic activity that meets the relevant screening criteria is considered as eligible. In the case of an adapted economic activity, at this time, only the costs of adaptation can be counted, not the revenues and/ or expenditure associated with the whole activity. This is because adaptation of an economic activity is delivered in activities that have primary objectives other than adaptation (for example adaptation of an electricity transmission line to increased risk of flood). When those activities are adapted to cope with physical climate risk, they contribute to the climate resilience of the entire, highly integrated and interconnected economic system and as a result, deliver a global benefit through aggregated adaptation in all sectors of an economy. However, methodologies, tools and metrics to measure these climate resilience benefits remain under development. These technical limitations mean that counting only the costs of adaptation of the economic activity is the most viable, conservative option today. In some circumstances, investments required to adapt an economy activity may be large and implemented in phases as part of an adaptation plan, which has been developed in response to a climate risk assessment. In these circumstances, investments in measures included in a full programme of actions that collectively reduce the material physical climate risks to the economic activity can be counted in phases, even if the whole adaptation plan has not been executed. It is expected that the full programme of measures would be executed over a period of time no longer than 5 years. It is proposed that, as a matter of priority, the Platform undertake further work to develop approaches for measuring the climate resilience benefits of adapted economic activities. This is a key step in moving towards recognising all revenue and/or expenditure associated with an economic activity that is adapted to cope with physical climate risk and yields high climate resilience benefits.The TEG has developed a classification of climate-related hazards. When developing the Taxonomy, the climate-related hazards considered are limited to the potential occurrence of a weather and climaterelated natural physical event or trend12. The climate-related hazard classification comprises four major hazard groups, with hazards related to water, temperature, wind, and mass-movements. All groups include acute (extreme) and chronic (slowonset) hazards, as adaptation must account for both rapid as well as gradual changes in the weather and climate to take the appropriate adaptation measures and avoid maladaptation.13 This analysis focusses on the most important or significant hazards and is designed to guide the user to consider the most salient physical risks when mapping the sensitivities of a given sector. All secondary hazards14 resulting from climate-related hazards (including but not limited to chemical, biological, ecological and epidemiological hazards) are excluded. It is however advisable to assess the risk of such secondary hazards and consider measures to address them for each economic activity.12 IPCC, 2014, Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report. Contribution of Working Groups I, II and III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Core Writing Team, R.K. Pachauri and L.A. Meyer (eds.)]. IPCC, Geneva, Switzerland, 151 pp (https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf, last visit 02/04/2019). 13 There are clearly linkages with disaster risk reduction in the effort of reducing physical climate risks resulting from extreme climate-related hazards. Geophysical and technological hazards are outside the domain of adaptation to climate change. 14 As an example, new biological pests or increased prevalence of existing pests can result from changing temperatures. Forests and agriculture are typically sensitive to warmer (minimum) temperatures and, in this example, their effects on pests. In this case, the changing prevalence of pests is a secondary hazard against which adaptation measures may be needed.Under the proposed Taxonomy regulation, economic activities making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation or adaptation must be assessed to ensure they do not cause significant harm to all remaining environmental objectives. An activity contributing to climate change mitigation must avoid significant harm to climate change adaptation and the other four environmental objectives: 3. 4. 5. 6.This assessment ensures that progress against some objectives are not made at the expense of others and recognises the reinforcing relationships between different environmental objectives. In its future development, the Taxonomy will also include activities that make a substantial contribution to the above objectivesPer Article 12 of the Taxonomy regulation, an economic activity shall be considered as significantly harming climate change adaptation “where that activity leads to an increased adverse impact of the current and expected climate, on itself or for other people, nature and assets”. In terms of what constitutes or leads to an increased negative effect of climate by an economic activity for and beyond the environment within which that economy activity takes place, it is proposed that the DNSH to adaptation criteria should ensure that both: The services that economic activities/ vulnerable populations/ vulnerable ecosystems rely on need to be resilient to climate change. If they are not and those services are significantly curtailed due to climate change impacts, the resilience and ability to adapt of those activities/ populations/ ecosystems is weakened. This can be achieved by ensuring that all material risks to the economic activity itself have been reduced to the extent possible and on a best effort basis.Discussion was had on whether compliance with these requirements should be determined on a case-bycase basis through an activity and context specific assessment, or whether an a-priori activity only level assessment is needed. As discussed above, adaptation needs and impacts of activities on adaptation and resilience are context specific and therefore a context specific assessment is needed. For these reasons, the two criteria described in Table 6 are proposed for “DNSH to adaptation” for all economic activities. In addition to these criteria, the TEG has considered where there are any examples of tools, methodology or other guidance that might be of use in applying these two criteria in the context of a specific economic activity. Where such examples have been identified, they have been noted in the DNSH to Adaptation section of the appropriate economic activity. It is noted that for new economic activities, the following criteria must be met at the point of design and construction. For existing activities and associated assets, where addressing physical climate risks requires a retrofit of some kind, all material physical climate risks must be assessed and adaptation measures required to address them must be identified and programmed with a clear and time limited execution plan no longer than 5 years. Table 6 – Do no significant harm to adaptation: ‘adapted economic activities’The activity integrates physical and non-physical measures aimed at reducing to the extent possible and on a best effort basis - all material risks that have been identified through a climate risk assessment. For existing activities, the implementation of those physical and non-physical measures may be phased and executed over a period of time of up to 5 years. For new activities, implementation of these measures must be met at the time of design and construction.The economic activity and its adaptation measures do not increase the risks of an adverse climate impact on other people, nature and assets or hamper adaptation elsewhere. Consideration should be given to the viability of 'green' or 'nature-based-solutions' over 'grey' measures to address adaptation.In accordance with Article 14 of the Taxonomy proposal, the DNSH criteria aim to specify the minimum requirements to be met to avoid significant harm to environmental objectives relevant to each economic activity. Article 12 provides further details on what constitutes significant harm for each environmental objective: Table 7 – Do no significant harm criteria: environmental objectives 3-6where that activity leads to significant inefficiencies in the use of materials and the direct or indirect use of natural resources such as non-renewable energy sources, raw materials, water and land in one or more stages of the life-cycle of products, including in terms of durability, reparability, upgradability, reusability or recyclability of products; or where that activity leads to a significant increase in the generation, incineration or disposal of waste, with the exception of incineration of nonrecyclable hazardous waste, or where the long term disposal of waste may cause significant and long-term harm to the environment;In addition, the regulation specifies that for all objectives: the environmental impacts of the activity itself, as well as of the products and services provided by that activity throughout their life cycle shall be taken into account, notably by considering their production, use and end-of life. The technical screening criteria proposed by the TEG contain quantitative thresholds where possible. Where this is not possible, the criteria are qualitative, describing an action or set of actions to be demonstrated which avoid significant harm. The baseline scenario for the economic activities is compliance with relevant EU environmental legislation. To this end, the criteria take into account existing EU legislation. The call for additional expertise to inform the TEG and the process described below enabled the establishment of criteria based on available scientific evidence. Where evidence was not conclusive, the precautionary principle enshrined in article 191 TFEU was taken into account, as required in Article 14 of the draft regulation. To the extent possible, the screening criteria, whether qualitative or quantitative, were selected to facilitate the verification of compliance. In many instances, the proposed criteria are expressed in terms of compliance with relevant EU legislation and/or associated reference information, such as the best available techniques (BAT) reference documents (also known as ‘BREFs’). 15 The technical screening criteria (TSC) process Figure 9 presents an overview of the process for development of DNSH technical screening criteria against activities expected to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. For each activity, the scope was reviewed to identify life cycle aspects and activity boundaries. Where linkages with other activities occurred (i.e. where life cycle aspects overlapped with other activities), this has been referenced in the analysis. 1.Initial screen for activities which could cause significant harm to each environmental objective. This analysis was carried out within the scope defined for the economic activity as identified for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation objectives. In this analysis, TEG members and additional experts have considered all material life cycle stages of the performance of the economic activity within the scope of the mitigation screening criteria.15 The BREF list of reference documents have been drawn (or are planned to be drawn) as part of the exchange of information carried out in the framework of Article 13(1) of the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED, 2010/75/EU) and other policy/legislative instruments. BREF are available at http://eippcb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reference/.Life cycle thinking. A life cycle approach was adopted to establish the technical screening criteria for DNSH in accordance with Article 14.1(f) of the Taxonomy proposal.16 This approach provided a robust way to avoid errors such as considering sustainable any economic activity that may have negative effects during its upstream or downstream stages. Questions asked and resolved included: a. what would generate significant harm during the life cycle of the activity? AND b. can this risk be addressed by complying with EU legislation and best practices, international standards or guidelines?Sectoral activities with high mitigation potential not included in the Taxonomy. Where ‘significant harm’ to one or more environmental objectives by the activity cannot be avoided through TEG requirements, the activity was not included in the Taxonomy. Material issues whereby an activity is considered unsuitable for inclusion in the Taxonomy may include but are not limited to: lack of empirical data for reasonable evaluation of DNSH (in line with the precautionary approach), lock-in and intergenerational risks.Evaluate and document key findings from relevant research and technical publications. Authoritative publications were reviewed to gain a comprehensive understanding of potential environmental exposures, and to identify material exposures for further consideration which may not be captured in existing EU legislation, BEMP, BAT and BREF.EU environmental acquis. Protection of the environmental objectives relating to water resources, circular economy, pollution prevention and the control and protection of ecosystems is advanced at the EU level with associated methodologies and thresholds, as contained in the existing body of EU environmental law (i.e. the environmental acquis). 17 Existing EU legal requirements apply across the Taxonomy. Therefore, for an activity to be included, it must at minimum comply with EU legal requirements, as well as national legal requirements and requirements relating to the environmental permits needed for its operation. EU legal requirements were considered as minimum requirements and were in general not repeated in the DNSH evaluation. When an environmental impact was considered significant, the relevant EU legal requirements (including BREF) and/or national requirements were included in the DNSH criteria, unless more specific requirements were deemed necessary to avoid significant harm.Global Context. The Taxonomy can potentially be used for economic activities outside of the EU. The technical screening criteria for DNSH provide necessary performance levels or thresholds for EU issued financial products.16 Article 14.1(f) states: The technical screening criteria adopted in accordance with Articles 6(2), 7(2), 8(2), 9(2), 10(2) and 11(2) shall take into account the environmental impacts of the economic activity itself, as well as of the products and services provided by that economic activity, notably by considering their production, use and end-of-life. 17 Access to EU environmental legislative and policy summaries is available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/browse/summaries.html.Splitting DNSH criteria. The scope of activities taken into consideration for DNSH mirrors the mitigation scope of activities. However, for a small number of activities two or three differing sets of DNSH criteria were deemed necessary. As an example, within the manufacturing macrosector, NACE code 20.13: Manufacture of other inorganic basic chemicals, there is one set of mitigation criteria and three sets of DNSH criteria divided into soda ash, carbon black and chlorine.Selection of technical screening criteria. The ‘do no significant harm’ evaluation focussed only on the most significant aspects of concern and developed threshold screening criteria where: a. avoiding significant harm requires criteria that differ from EU legislation b. alignment with international standards, laws, conventions and the global SDGs was considered necessary c. issues were identified as most significant in a global context, even if resolved at the European level d. special care was needed to address local geographical/physical, climatological and/or hydrological conditions e. other sectoral specific aspects concerning one or more of the DNSH objectives, as detailed in the rationale, were foundThis report uses NACE for industry classification and the TEG has developed screening criteria for priority sectors within NACE. Other activities may be also eligible, so long as the company or investor can demonstrate compliance with the substantial contribution criteria and that no significant harm has been done to any other environmental objective. Examples of these include: Manufacturing For some corporates who manufacture as well as sell the end products, they may attribute revenue to the end product rather than to the manufacturing process. Technical screening criteria in this report lays out expectations of the manufacturing process. When aligning testing criteria to manufacturing, it may be necessary to review revenue classified to the sale of the end product by the same organisation, even though the eligible activity would be assessed within the manufacturing processes. This is not a supply chain assessment, the corporate needs to own the manufacturing process to qualify. For example, technical screening criteria are provided under NACE code 23.51 – Manufacture of Cement. However revenue for these manufacturing processes may be attributed under: NameGreen debt or lending activities may be allocated a NACE or equivalent industry classification code. Where financial instruments are allocated a NACE listed in this report, the substantial contribution and significant harm tests can be applied as listed. However, there may be some examples where the activity may be suitable to test, even if the industry or sector of the overall business may not be listed within this report. Such examples include:Multi-sector eligibility Where the proceeds of a bond or loan are allocated to a project, and the project is allocated across more than one sector (e.g. solar, hydro and wind investments), then each of the projects or assets shall meet the specific eligibility criteria provided within this taxonomy report (Production of Electricity from Hydropower, Solar PV or Wind Power). If the capital allocation to the projects was split evenly across the three activities and only one of the projects satisfied the technical screening criteria, then only 33% of the investment would qualify.Why forestry is included in the Taxonomy The Taxonomy defines forest in accordance with the definitions of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.18 In this context, a forest is considered as “Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.” (UNFAO, 2019)19. In the context of the Taxonomy, plantations forests are specifically excluded. Plantations are defined by the FAO as “Planted Forest that is intensively managed and meet ALL the following criteria at planting and stand maturity: one or two species, even age class, and regular spacing. 1. Specifically includes: short rotation plantation for wood, fibre and energy; 2 Specifically excludes: forest planted for protection or ecosystem restoration; 3. Specifically excludes: Forest established through planting or seeding which at stand maturity resembles or will resemble naturally regenerating forest. Recognising that countries or country groups may set specific definitions of forest to represent specific regional conditions, the Taxonomy allows for the use of forest definitions developed under regional processes, such as Forest Europe, and various agreements, such as the International Tropical Timber Agreement etc., providing that these are aligned with the FAO definition. When applying to be Taxonomy aligned, the specific definition (if different from FAO) should be set out and the alignment with FAO definition demonstrated clearly. For the purposes of the Taxonomy, significant mitigation achievement for Forestry is judged through improvement in activities’ own performance, with a focus on the maintenance of forest carbon stocks and sinks and increase of sequestration potential within the sector. Forests cover around 30% of the global landmass (in Europe this figure is higher at ~40-45%) and absorb roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year.20 Forests regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, play an integral part in the carbon cycle, support livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth. EU forests already account for more than 20% of the global forest carbon sink, and yet an increase in carbon sequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a net-zero target by 2050 in Europe and globally.21 Given the necessity to maintain the existing forest carbon sink, conservation finance is enabled within the forest sector, i.e. finance that supports the maintenance and protection of forest areas, regardless of whether they are used for economic production. The introduction of conservation forests that may have no productive function, into the Taxonomy should aid in the alignment of the Taxonomy as it develops to include substantial contribution to other environmental objectives.18 FAO FRA 2020. 19 UN FAO (2019) Global forest resource assessment 2020: terms and definitions FRA.

The FAO FRA definition of reforestation excludes natural regeneration. However, the Taxonomy recognises the importance of natural regeneration to the increased carbon sink and stock potential provided by forests in general. It is therefore included explicitly within this context in line with the FAO FRA definition of naturally regenerating forest 31.Existing forest management: management of land that is reported as forest, in accordance with the Sustainable Forest Management principles. SFM is further defined by Forest Europe as: 'sustainable forest management' means using forests and forest land in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the29 IPCC, 2014. 30 While the forest Taxonomy focuses on enhancing the mitigation potential of forestry activities, it reinforces the importance of reducing deforestation globally, and reiterates the importance of the international guiding principles against deforestation provided by the UNREDD. 31 Forest predominantly composed of trees established through natural regeneration. Explanatory notes: 1. Includes forests for which it is not possible to distinguish whether planted or naturally regenerated. 2. Includes forests with a mix of naturally regenerated native tree species and planted/seeded trees, and where the naturally regenerated trees are expected to constitute the major part of the growing stock at stand maturity. 3. Includes coppice from trees originally established through natural regeneration. 4. Includes naturally regenerated trees of introduced species.Conservation forests: Conservation forests are defined here as those in which the ‘primary designated management objective’ (FAO FRA definition) is that of conservation. Specifically, those forests where the management objectives are ‘conservation of biodiversity’ or ‘social services’ based on the FAO FRA definitions (Box 1).Box 1: FAO FRA definitions relating to conservation forests 1. PRIMARY DESIGNATED MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE: The primary designated management objective assigned to a management unit. Explanatory notes: a. In order to be considered primary, the management objective should be significantly more important than other management objectives. b. Primary management objectives are exclusive, and area reported under one primary management objective should not be reported for any other primary management objectives. c. Nation-wide general management objectives established in national legislation or policies (such as e.g. “all forest land should be managed for production, conservation and social purposes”) should not be considered as management objectives in this context. 2. CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY: Forest where the management objective is conservation of biological diversity. Includes but is not limited to areas designated for biodiversity conservation within the protected areas. Explanatory note: a. Includes wildlife reserves, High Conservation Values, key habitats and forest designated or managed for wildlife habitat protection. 3. SOCIAL SERVICES: Forest where the management objective is social services. Explanatory notes: a. Includes services such as: recreation, tourism, education, research and/or conservation of cultural/spiritual sites. b.Due to changes in practices in the category “afforestation” and “reforestation”, which changes from practices connected with newly established forest to first tending operations, it is proposed to transfer these two categories to the NACE category “existing forest management” or “conservation forestry” (depending on the objective of the management) after the 20 years period, following the EU LULUCFCriteria and thresholds Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation (e.g. the Renewable Energy Directive and its recast, EU LULUCF, EU Nature Directives, EU FLEGT, EU Timber Regulation, etc.), national forest legislation, international standards and best practices and international processes, such as the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (Forest Europe). The Taxonomy recognizes that, although the EU has a variety of forest-related policies, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy, and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which include a long history of long-term planning in national and regional regulations. The Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure sustainable management of forest areas; a measured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) (and/or maintained in the case of existing forest management) and permanent. All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are: 1. Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services. SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems’. 33 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the adoption of34 FSC/PEFC estimate that about 54% of forests globally are productive and/or used for multiple purposes, of which 20% are certified by FSC and PEFC. See Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019.Adaptation responses shall comply with requirement set out in Article 29(7)b of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (EU/2018/2001) which determines the requirement for management systems to be in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or strengthened over the long term35.Impact of these proposals Approximately 430,000 enterprises are active in wood-based industries across the EU, representing 20% of EU manufacturing enterprises and 7.5% of the gross value-added of the manufacturing industry in Europe.36 The wood industry provides around 3.5 million jobs in the EU. 37 Around 60% of EU forests are privately owned, of which 2/3 have holdings of less than 3 hectares 38, many times fragmented into smaller plots. The structure of private forest ownership is specific and considerable variations exist from country to country, with properties sizes ranging from 0.5 hectares to more than 10,000 hectares, while the average size is around 13 hectares. Forest owners and managers with similar forest characteristics, under similar climate conditions and jurisdictions, are expected to be equally impacted. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No Significant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests in the EU39, and around 20% of productive forests globally.40 Other forests/forest35 Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or strengthened over the long term. This is explicitly defined in Article 29(7)b which requires “…management systems are in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or strengthened over the long term.” This places the emphasis of the no significant harm requirement at a level more appropriate for the operation of the Taxonomy and/or investment, rather than relying on national level requirements. 36 In 2017. https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Wood_products_-_production_and_trade 37 https://ec.europa.eu/info/events/forestry-conference-2019-apr-25_en 38 UNECE Geneva Timber And Forest Study Paper 26: Private Forest Ownership in Europe 39 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. 40 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019.Next steps (recommendations to the Platform) The following issues have not been addressed in this version of the forest Taxonomy criteria. However, they may provide additional mitigation opportunities for the sector and therefore merit consideration by the Platform on Sustainable Finance: The forest Taxonomy sets out criteria and thresholds for forest management activities that apply up to the forest gate irrespective of the end-use of the forest products. This is for the pragmatic reason that many forest managers and owners do not know in which supply chains their products will arise. In principle however, the Taxonomy recognises the holistic mitigation potential of forests and wood beyond the forest gate both through the effect of substitution (replacing more GHG intensive materials) and through the long-term carbon sink potential of wood products. Furthermore, the forest Taxonomy deals with the production and supply of forest biomass, but not the demand or end use of that biomass. The relationship between the end use of biomass and its production, i.e. market pull, is an important component of the overall sustainable finance Taxonomy to consider when incentivising different NACE sectors towards substantial contribution to mitigation. At present climate benefits beyond the forest gate are expected to be captured through the construction/building, energy and manufacturing sector Taxonomies, and thus create an incentive for the use of wood in the economy, and thus the management of forests in compliance with the Taxonomy. The Platform should therefore improve the holistic consideration of forests’ (and forest products) mitigation potential across their entire value chains, and across all sectors of the economy, including end of life. The following recommendations are made in the context of other NACE sectors:The development of reliable thresholds for carbon emission embodied in buildings and construction activities utilising wood. These thresholds should be based on a wide and consistent set of data able to benchmark best practice across different building uses and typologies (i.e. houses, flats, offices, etc.). In parallel, the methodology to be used to assess embodied emissions should be defined in detail on the basis of widely-accepted LCA and CEN/TC350 standards, with particular care to ensure that the beneficial impact of carbon sequestration in timber products sourced from sustainably-managed forests is adequately recognised. This should include the end of life of wood and construction timber.Making a subjective view that wood is a prime raw material with climate mitigation benefits, and should be considered with priority for construction (as a criteria for substantial contribution to mitigation). This would aid in incentivising the use of wood within the economy and for the long-term sequestration of carbon in timber products. In the current proposals,DNSH for construction using timber is addressed through a requirement for FSC and PECF certification. This is helpful in the short-term, but in the longer-term the platform should consider ensuring that wood used in construction comes from Taxonomy compliant forests.The manufacturing Taxonomy should systematically consider the substitution potential of wood as a manufacturing material. Progress has been made in this regard under current NACE 4.7 (Manufacture of other organic base chemicals). This approach is welcomed and should be expanded across other manufacturing NACE sectors. Specifically, it is suggested that the manufacturing Taxonomy includes NACE C16 (Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials) and C31 (Manufacture of furniture) and develop robust and verifiable substitution criteria (to ensure substantial mitigation) and DNSH criteria (see above proposal for buildings).When considering the development of Circular Economy principles into the Taxonomy, both as DNSH and as substantial contribution, the Platform should give specific consideration to the use of forest products throughout different economic sectors.The current proposal does not capture or address all possible sources of emissions taking place in the forest during the lifetime of a forest project or activity. For example, the Taxonomy does not account for fuel use by machinery within the forest sector (which is currently accounted for in the energy and transport sectors).The Platform should further explore broadening the current criteria to account for individual improvements, measures, to be eligible as individual investments towards meeting the overall forest activity criteria, i.e. the substantial mitigation objective.GHG measurement is required for above-ground carbon sequestration on the basis that belowground carbon is technically more challenging to assess and measure overtime. Instead, belowground carbon shall be maintained and/or increased through a proxy, i.e. the application of management practices, reflected through cumulative Sustainable Forest Management and Do No Significant Harm requirements. The Platform is advised to further explore below-ground carbon measurements and review existing impact assessment methodologies that might complement the current threshold for below-ground carbon measurements. It is further suggested that the Platform consider the approach to soil-carbon in the agriculture Taxonomy and whether there should be alignment also for the forest Taxonomy.It is the view of the TEG that these criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance with the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification approaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. It is recommended that the Platform further develops guidance, including a more granular mapping of the Taxonomy criteria and thresholds, with existing internationally recognised and applicable forest certification schemes. This would provide support to investors and forest management companies and individuals when seeking compliance with the Taxonomy.In the context of interlinkages between Taxonomy sectors, the impact of deforestation is often a result of other-sector activities (such as agriculture or building development) rather than forestry. The Platform are invited to consider whether deforestation is sufficiently addressed in other Taxonomy sectors, in order to support substantial contribution in the forest sector and as a DNSH to mitigation in the forest sector as enabled through other Taxonomy sectors.The Platform should further explore potential end-user issues and opportunities for investors and financial institutions, including potential challenges that may arise in relation to associating capital expenditures or revenues that can be tagged or screened through the current criteria set for forest management/land use activities. For example, an investor may invest in a wood processing facility, which itself is not covered by the current forest Taxonomy sectors, but the operation of the facility will interact with the management of forests and the use of forest products. Clarity should be provided to investors on where and at what point in the value/supply chain they are expected to consider compliance with the Taxonomy – specifically for sectors upstream or downstream of the specific investment. oThe Platform is invited to consider and develop further the performance period for the existing forest management NACE. With the proposed Taxonomy for existing forest management, a pragmatic view has been taken to align performance with the commercial rotation period of a forest – i.e. allowing for changes in carbon stock within a forest and providing flexibility given that different forests will be harvested at different periods. This implicitly recognises that the forest will remain forest and when managed under SFM, continue to sequester carbon. Importantly this means that the forest may be harvested at a commercial point determined by wood quality and quantity and not at a point where the forest has reached a carbon stock saturation point – which may be considerably longer. The Platform is therefore asked to consider if it is sufficient to have additionality provided through SFM and DNSH, but that for existing forest management substantial contribution can be judged as the maintenance of the forest carbon stock rather than its increase. Whilst the focus of this Taxonomy is on greening of activities, it may be relevant to consider the end use of the forest biomass when reflecting on this point – in that aroundAfforestation Afforestation is defined as the establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land that, until then, was under a different land use, implies a transformation of land use from non-forest to forest41.Criterion 1: Mandatory application of the following Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements: o Identify and apply forest management practices that increase existing carbon stocks, considering the non-exhaustive list of examples practices in the Annex F2, however allowing for application of other similar approaches, that recognise local specificities and conditions, while maintaining or improving soil quality, and biodiversity; o Maintain or improve the long-term capacity of the forest to deliver multiple services (e.g. ecosystem services, timber production, etc.); o Do not convert high carbon stock land (i.e. primary forest, peatlands, wetlands, and grasslands) which has this status in or after January 2008; o Carry out harvesting activities in compliance with laws in the country of origin42; o Regenerate harvested forests. Criterion 2: Establish a verified baseline GHG balance of relevant carbon pools at the beginning of the afforestation/reforestation activity; Criterion 3: Demonstrate continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management requirements and increase of carbon sinks from above and below-ground carbon over time, supported by and disclosed41 Source: FAO, Global Forest Resources Assessment, 2020 42 Where standards and requirements under national laws are equivalent or better in delivering substantial mitigation, than the SFM requirements of the Taxonomy.Continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements is demonstrated and disclosed at 10-year intervals through a forest management plan (or equivalent) that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3). Verified GHG balance baseline43 is calculated for above-ground carbon pools, based on growth-yield curves for species per m3/year/ha, carbon convertible. Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide. Above ground Carbon stocks shall increase above carbon baseline over a period of 20 years44. Changes in carbon stocks should be disclosed based on growth yield curves in 10 year intervals through a forest management plan (or equivalent instrument45) that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3)46.Rationale Forests cover around 30% of the global landmass (in Europe this figure is higher at ~40-45%) and absorb roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year.47 Forests regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity,43 Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of planting). The increment based on the growth-yield curves gives the approximate number of how many m3/year/ha is available for increment. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide 44 20 years aligns with the measurement of carbon and under LULUCF regulation land that was afforested moves from category “afforestation” to “forest land” after 20 years 45 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal may be to perform at a scale above the single forest stand. Absence of landscape management access will in turn require disclosure at the single forest stand. The Forest Taxonomy leaves to forest owners and companies to explain, document on which level they report. 46 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause: underperformance resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in non-compliance with the Taxonomy criteria. 47 http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/.The Taxonomy acknowledges a definitional change from ‘afforestation’ and ‘reforestation’ to ‘existing forest management’ according to the LULUCF Regulations 20-year accounting rule as per Art. 5(3). The approach taken to determine metrics and thresholds rely on cumulative criteria. Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation and the Taxonomy recognizes that, although the EU has a variety of forest-related policies, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy, and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which include a long history of longterm planning in national and regional regulations. The Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure sustainable management of forest areas; a measured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) and permanent. All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are:1. Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services. SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems’.49 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), and apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forestSFM requirements use EU legislation as minimum baseline and build on the REDII, and existing industry best practice criteria e.g. Climate Bonds Initiative’s Forestry criteria, the Forest Europe general guidelines for sustainable forest management.To help with application of the criteria, the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 a non-exhaustive list of activities that would, if implemented effectively, lead to the achievement of the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks, and conservation of non-productive functions. The aim of the list is to provide support to operators and investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented. Recognising the different conditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can be demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome. SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stock land areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land use change. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g. ISCC and RSPO RED). Harvesting activities must be carried out in compliance with national laws in the country of origin, shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable. Regeneration of forests after harvesting is covered under EU legislation and has been included as a requirement to ensure regeneration is taken into consideration for forest activities outside the EU. SFM requirements should be considered in combination with the Do No Significant Harm criteria. They can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited.2. Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growthyield curves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHG emissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon pools (above and below-ground) as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B. Specifically: (a) above-ground biomass; (b) below-ground biomass; (c) litter; (d) dead wood; (e) soil organic carbon, with the exclusion of (f) harvested wood products in the land accounting categories of afforested land and managed forest land, which is beyond the scope of this Taxonomy. However, it recognises the challenges of below-ground carbon measurement. Therefore, the specific criteria used in the fiches focuses on the measurement of above-ground carbon pools only.  The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context specific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of50 FSC/PEFC estimate that about 54% of forests globally are productive and/or used for multiple purposes, of which 20% are certified by FSC and PEFC. See Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019.maintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forest carbon stocks. Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide.3. Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criteria 1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-year intervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities. Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over a period of 20 years for afforestation projects.  In order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomy accounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and the demonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, aboveground biomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects.  SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration from below-ground biomass, dead organic matter or soils: increase in carbon sequestration from below ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it.  Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be demonstrated after 20 years of the afforestation/reforestation project. This aligns with the measurement of carbon and under LULUCF regulation where land that was afforested moves from category “afforestation” to “forest land” after 20 years. A 20-year period for maintaining carbon sinks and activities also follows the IPCC time frame of 20 years to saturation for soil carbon.  Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These include approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level (multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for the investment.International relevance of the forest Taxonomy It is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance with the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification approaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularlyAlignment with existing legislation In order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider alignment with existing EU legislative instruments and established agreements. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements align with existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislation provides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where legislation allows for more substantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach to minimise the risk of using forest biomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-national laws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Paris agreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or strengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed in the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article 29 does not require an explicit ‘substantial contribution’ to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, the compliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based, however through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws or management systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks to establish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation can be assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding. Do no significant harm assessment Key environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows: 51 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. 52 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019.Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented.Minimise the use of pesticides and favour alternative approaches or techniques, such as non-chemical alternatives to pesticides, in line with the Directive 2009/128/EC on the sustainable use of pesticides. With exception of occasions that this is needed to control pest and diseases outbreaks. Adapt the use of fertilizers to what is needed to prevent leeching of nutrients to waters.Take well documented and verifiable measures to avoid the use of active ingredients that are listed in the Stockholm Convention, the Rotterdam Convention, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, or that are listed as classification Ia or Ib in the WHO recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard;No conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss or of high conservation value such as grasslands and any high carbon stock area (e.g. peat lands and wetlands), and areas set aside for the restoration of such habitats in line with national legislationLandscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal to preserve conservation status for different species is at a scale above the single forest stand. 54 This criterion should be considered in combination with criterion 3 of the mitigation criteria to disclose through a forest management plan (or equivalent).Select native species or species, varieties, ecotypes and provenance of trees that adequately provide the necessary resilience to climate change, natural disasters and the biotic, pedologic and hydrologic condition of the area concerned, as well as the potential invasive character of the species under local conditions, current and projected climate change.Criterion 1: Mandatory application of the following Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements: o Identify and apply forest management practices that increase existing carbon stocks , considering the non-exhaustive list of examples practices in the Annex F2, however allowing for application of other similar approaches, that recognise local specificities and conditions, while maintaining or improving soil quality, and biodiversity; o Maintain or improve the long-term capacity of the forest to deliver multiple services (e.g. ecosystem services, timber production, etc.); o Do not convert high carbon stock land (i.e. primary forest, peatlands, wetlands, and grasslands) which has this status in or after January 2008; o Carry out harvesting activities in compliance with laws in the country of origin56; o Regenerate harvested forests. Criterion 2: Establish a verified baseline GHG balance of relevant carbon pools at the beginning of the rehabilitation and restoration activity;Criterion 3: Demonstrate continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management requirements and increase of carbon from above and below-ground carbon over time, supported by and disclosed through a forest management plan (or equivalent) at 10year intervals, that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities.Continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements is demonstrated and continuously disclosed at 10 -year intervals through a forest management plan (or equivalent instrument) that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3).Verified GHG balance baseline57 is calculated for above-ground carbon pools, based on growth-yield curves for species per m3/year/ha, carbon convertible. Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growthyield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide.Above ground Carbon stocks shall increase above carbon baseline over the rotation period of the forest58. Changes in carbon stocks should be disclosed based on growth yield curves in 10 year intervals through a forest management plan (or equivalent instrument59) that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3) 60.57 Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of planting). The increment based on the growth-yield curves gives the approximate number of how many m3/year/ha is available for increment. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide 58 The rotation period is here defined as the time from seeding, planting or natural regeneration through to the point of harvest. 59 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal may be to perform at a scale above the single forest stand. Absence of landscape management access will in turn require disclosure at the single forest stand. The Forest Taxonomy leaves to forest owners and companies to explain, document on which level they report. 60 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause: underperformance resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in non-compliance with the Taxonomy criteria.The Taxonomy acknowledges a definitional change from ‘afforestation’ and ‘reforestation’ to ‘existing forest management’ and ‘rehabilitation’ according to the LULUCF Regulations 20-year accounting rule as per Art. 5(3). The approach taken to determine metrics and thresholds rely on cumulative criteria. Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation and the Taxonomy recognizes that, although the EU has a variety of forest-related policies, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy, and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which include a long history of longterm planning in national and regional regulations. The Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure sustainable management of forest areas; a measured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) and permanent. All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are:1. Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services. SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems’.63 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified),SFM requirements use EU legislation as minimum baseline and build on the REDII, and existing industry best practice criteria e.g. Climate Bonds Initiative’s Forestry criteria, the Forest Europe general guidelines for sustainable forest management.To help with application of the criteria, the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 a non-exhaustive list of activities that would, if implemented effectively, lead to the achievement of the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks, and conservation of non-productive functions. The aim of the list is to provide support to operators and investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented. Recognising the different conditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can be demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome. SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stock land areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land use change. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g. ISCC and RSPO RED). Harvesting activities must be carried out in compliance with national laws in the country of origin, shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable. Regeneration of forests after harvesting is covered under EU legislation and has been included as a requirement to ensure regeneration is taken into consideration for forest activities outside the EU. SFM requirements should be considered in combination with the Do No Significant Harm criteria. They can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited.2. Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-yield curves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHG emissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon pools (above and below-ground) as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B. Specifically: (a) above-ground biomass; (b) below-ground biomass; (c) litter; (d) dead wood; (e) soil organic carbon, with the exclusion of (f) harvested wood products in the land accounting categories of afforested land and managed forest land, which is beyond the scope of this Taxonomy. However, it recognises the challenges of below-ground carbon measurement. Therefore, the specific criteria used in the tables focuses on the measurement of above-ground carbon pools only.64 FSC/PEFC estimate that about 54% of forests globally are productive and/or used for multiple purposes, of which 20% are certified by FSC and PEFC. See Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019.The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context specific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of maintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forest carbon stocks. Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide.3. Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criterion 1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-year intervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities. Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over the rotation period of the forest for restoration projects.  In order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomy accounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and the demonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, aboveground biomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects.  SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration from below-ground biomass, dead organic matter or soils: increase in carbon sequestration from below ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it.  Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be demonstrated relative to the rotation period of the forest. Progress in the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a verified baseline, over the rotation period of the forest, which reflects and adapts to the industry’s levels of maturity, climate conditions, location features and market structures. For restoration/rehabilitation the forest will include stands at varying stages of maturity, within the context of an established forest. From a substantial mitigation perspective, the view is taken that the maintenance of the carbon stock of the forest is important, and recognises that beyond a point, carbon stocks may reach a saturation point in the above-ground biomass. Respecting the commercial function of many forests, forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation. However, providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of net-annual increment, the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time. In practical terms, for rehabilitation/restoration of forests, the forest owner will be required to define the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or landscape level. In order to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate, relative to the rotation period, that carbon stocks have been maintained (against baseline) or increased (from baseline). Importantly the performance/demonstration period is linked to the rotation period, but supported through 10-year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel, i.e. that carbon stocks are being maintained or increasing. In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a forest stand from fire or wind-throw, the existing forest management NACE will move to therestoration NACE, and performance will be judged on the basis of the re-establishment of the forest stand and thus carbon stock development over a period of 20-years. Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These include approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level (multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for the investment.International relevance of the forest Taxonomy It is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance with the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification approaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No Significant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria that varies across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests in the EU65, and around 20% of productive forests globally. 66 Other forests/forest projects (i.e. noncertified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market with certainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the DNSH criteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (including carbon measurement and performance).Alignment with existing legislation In order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider alignment with existing EU legislative instruments. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements align with existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislation provides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objectives and where legislation allows for more substantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach to minimise the risk of using forest biomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-national laws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Paris agreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or strengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed in the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article65 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. 66 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019.The DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest mitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1). The criteria can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Compliance shall be reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent) as per criterion 3 of the forest mitigation Taxonomy. (2) AdaptationIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented.Minimise the use of pesticides and favour alternative approaches or techniques, such as non-chemical alternatives to pesticides, in line with the Directive 2009/128/EC on the sustainable use of pesticides. With exception of occasions that this is needed to control pest and diseases outbreaks. Adapt the use of fertilizers to what is needed to prevent leeching of nutrients to waters.Take well documented and verifiable measures to avoid the use of active ingredients that are listed in the Stockholm Convention, the Rotterdam Convention, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, or that are listed as classification Ia or Ib in the WHO recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard;No conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss or of high conservation value such as grasslands and any high carbon stock area (e.g. peat lands and wetlands), and areas set aside for the restoration of such habitats in line with national legislationPromote close-to-nature forestry or similar concepts depending on the local requirements and limitations; Select native species or species, varieties, ecotypes and provenance of trees that adequately provide the necessary resilience to climate change, natural disasters and the biotic, pedologic and hydrologic condition of the area concerned, as well as the potential invasive character of the species under local conditions, current and projected climate change.67 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal to preserve conservation status for different species is at a scale above the single forest stand. 68 This criterion should be considered in combination with criterion 3 of the mitigation criteria to disclose through a forest management plan (or equivalent).Reforestation Reforestation is defined as the re-establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land classified as forest. It implies no change of land use, includes planting/seeding of temporarily un-stocked forest areas as well as planting/seeding of areas with forest cover. It includes coppice from trees that were originally planted or seeded69. The FAO FRA definition of reforestation excludes natural regeneration. However, the Taxonomy recognises the importance of natural regeneration to the increased carbon sink and stock potential provided by forests in general. It is therefore included explicitly within this context in line with the FAO FRA definition of naturally regenerating forest70. In the context of the Taxonomy, the category ‘reforestation’ applies in cases following extreme events (wind throws, fires etc.), and not as part of normal, legally binding obligation to reforest after harvesting.Criterion 1: Mandatory application of the following Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements: o Identify and apply forest management practices that increase existing carbon stocks , considering the non-exhaustive list of examples practices in the Annex F2, however allowing for69 Source: FAO, Global Forest Resources Assessment, 2020. 70 Forest predominantly composed of trees established through natural regeneration. Explanatory notes: 1. Includes forests for which it is not possible to distinguish whether planted or naturally regenerated. 2. Includes forests with a mix of naturally regenerated native tree species and planted/seeded trees, and where the naturally regenerated trees are expected to constitute the major part of the growing stock at stand maturity. 3. Includes coppice from trees originally established through natural regeneration. 4. Includes naturally regenerated trees of introduced species.application of other similar approaches, that recognise local specificities and conditions, while maintaining or improving soil quality, and biodiversity; o Maintain or improve the long-term capacity of the forest to deliver multiple services (e.g. ecosystem services, timber production, etc.); o Do not convert high carbon stock land (i.e. primary forest, peatlands, wetlands, and grasslands) which has this status in or after January 2008; o Carry out harvesting activities in compliance with laws in the country of origin71; o Regenerate harvested forests. Criterion 2: Establish a verified baseline GHG balance of relevant carbon pools at the beginning of the afforestation/reforestation activity; Criterion 3: Demonstrate continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management requirements and increase of carbon stock from above and below-ground carbon over time, supported by and disclosed through a forest management plan (or equivalent) at 10-year intervals, that shall be reviewed by an independent thirdparty certifier and/or competent authorities.Continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements is demonstrated and continuously disclosed at 10 -year intervals through a forest management plan (or equivalent instrument) that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3).Verified GHG balance baseline72 is calculated for aboveground carbon pools, based on growth-yield curves for species per m3/year/ha, carbon convertible. Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees. Using the growthyield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis71 Where standards and requirements under national laws are equivalent or better in delivering substantial mitigation, than the SFM requirements of the Taxonomy. 72 Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of planting). The increment based on the growth-yield curves gives the approximate number of how many m3/year/ha is available for increment. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxideAbove ground Carbon stocks shall increase above carbon baseline over a period of 20 years73. Changes in carbon stocks should be disclosed based on growth yield curves in 10 year intervals through a forest management plan (or equivalent instrument74) that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3)75.Rationale Forests cover around 30% of the global landmass (In Europe this figure is higher at ~40-45%) and absorb roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year.76 Forests regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, play an integral part in the carbon cycle, support livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth. EU forests already account for more than 20% of the global forest carbon sink, and yet an increase in carbon sequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a net-zero target by 2050 in Europe and globally.77 Forests can deliver substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation through sequestration of carbon during tree growth and in the accumulation of biomass in soils, vegetation, leaf litter and dead wood (up to forest gate). Reforestation activities can deliver substantial mitigation through: 73 20 years aligns with the measurement of carbon and under LULUCF regulation land that was afforested moves from category “afforestation” to “forest land” after 20 years 74 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal may be to perform at a scale above the single forest stand. Absence of landscape management access will in turn require disclosure at the single forest stand. The Forest Taxonomy leaves to forest owners and companies to explain, document on which level they report. 75 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause: underperformance resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in non-compliance with the Taxonomy criteria. 76 http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/. 77 European Forest Institute.1. Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services. SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems’.78 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), and apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forest owners, buyers of timber and/or residues and forest management companies to verify compliance with the criteria in Europe and globally. 79 SFM requirements use EU legislation as minimum baseline and build on the REDII, and existing industry best practice criteria e.g. Climate Bonds Initiative’s Forestry criteria, the Forest Europe general guidelines for sustainable forest management.To help with application of the criteria, the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 a non-exhaustive list of activities that would, if implemented effectively, lead to the achievement of the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks, and conservation of non-productive functions. The aim of the list is to provide support to operators and investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented.

This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g. ISCC and RSPO RED).FSC/PEFC estimate that about 54% of forests globally are productive and/or used for multiple purposes, of which 20% are certified by FSC and PEFC.

Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be demonstrated after 20 years of the afforestation/reforestation project. This aligns with the measurement of carbon and under LULUCF regulation where land that was afforested moves from category “afforestation” to “forest land” after 20 years. A 20-year period for maintaining carbon sinks and activities also follows the IPCC time frame of 20 years to saturation for soil carbon. Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level.

It is important to recognise where legislation80 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. 81 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019.The DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest mitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1).

SFM is further defined by Forest Europe as: 'sustainable forest management' means using forests and forest land in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems 84.Criterion 1: Mandatory application of the following Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements: o Identify and apply forest management practices that increase existing carbon stocks , considering the nonexhaustive list of examples practices in the Annex F2, however allowing for application of other similar approaches, that recognise local specificities and conditions, while maintaining or improving soil quality, and biodiversity; o Maintain or improve the long-term capacity of the forest to deliver multiple services (e.g. ecosystem services, timber production, etc.); o Do not convert high carbon stock land (i.e. primary forest, peatlands, wetlands, and grasslands) which has this status in or after January 2008; o Carry out harvesting activities in compliance with laws in the country of origin85; o Regenerate harvested forests.84 https://foresteurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MC_lisbon_resolutionL2_with_annexes.pdf#page=18. 85 Where standards and requirements under national laws are equivalent or better in delivering substantial mitigation, than the SFM requirements of the Taxonomy.Criterion 3: Demonstrate continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management requirements and maintain or increase of carbon sinks from above and below-ground carbon over time, supported by and disclosed through a forest management plan (or equivalent) at 10-year intervals, that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities.Continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements is demonstrated and continuously disclosed at 10 -year intervals through a forest management plan (or equivalent instrument) that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3).Verified GHG balance baseline86 is calculated for above-ground carbon pools, based on growth-yield curves for species per m3/year/ha, carbon convertible. Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees. Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide.Above ground Carbon stocks shall be maintained or increased relative to the carbon baseline over the rotation period of the forest87. Changes in carbon stocks should be disclosed based on growth yield curves in 10-year intervals88 through a forest management plan (or equivalent instrument) that shall be reviewed by an independent86 Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of planting). The increment based on the growth-yield curves gives the approximate number of how many m3/year/ha is available for increment. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide 87 The rotation period is here defined as the time from seeding, planting or natural regeneration through to the point of harvest. 88 A description of above ground carbon state of play is required every 10 years to ensure steady and overall progress is aimed for and achieved. That aligns with management cycles time horizons performed in the European Union as well as National Forest Inventories.The Taxonomy acknowledges a definitional change from ‘afforestation’ and ‘reforestation’ to ‘existing forest management’ and ‘rehabilitation’ according to the LULUCF Regulations 20-year accounting rule as per Art. 5(3). The approach taken to determine metrics and thresholds rely on cumulative criteria. Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation and the Taxonomy recognizes that, although the EU has a variety of forest-related policies, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy, and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which include a long history of longterm planning in national and regional regulations.89 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause: underperformance resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in non-compliance with the Taxonomy criteria. 90 http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/. 91 European Forest Institute.1. Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services. SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems’.92 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), and apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forest owners, buyers of timber and/or residues and forest management companies to verify compliance with the criteria in Europe and globally. 93 SFM requirements use EU legislation as minimum baseline and build on the REDII, and existing industry best practice criteria e.g. Climate Bonds Initiative’s Forestry criteria, the Forest Europe general guidelines for sustainable forest management.To help with application of the criteria, the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 a non-exhaustive list of activities that would, if implemented effectively, lead to the achievement of the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks, and conservation of non-productive functions. The aim of the list is to provide support to operators and investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented. Recognising the different conditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can be demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome. SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stock land areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land use change. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g. ISCC and RSPO RED). Harvesting activities must be carried out in compliance with national laws in the country of origin, shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable. Regeneration of forests after harvesting is covered under EU legislation and has been included as a requirement to ensure regeneration is taken into consideration for forest activities outside the EU. SFM requirements should be considered in combination with the Do No Significant Harm criteria. They can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited.92 https://foresteurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MC_lisbon_resolutionL2_with_annexes.pdf#page=18. 93 FSC/PEFC estimate that about 54% of forests globally are productive and/or used for multiple purposes, of which 20% are certified by FSC and PEFC. See Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019.3. Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criteria 1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-year intervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities. A description of state of play is required every 10 years to ensure steady and overall progress is aimed for and achieved. That aligns with management cycles time horizons performed in the EU as well as National Forest Inventories, performed on a 10-year basis. In order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomy accounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and the demonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, aboveground biomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects. SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration from below-ground biomass, dead organic matter or soils: increase in carbon sequestration from below ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it. Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be demonstrated relative to the rotation period of the forest. Progress in the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a verified baseline, over the rotation period of the forest, which reflects and adapts to the industry’s levels of maturity, climate conditions, location features and market structures. For restoration/rehabilitation the forest will include stands at varying stages of maturity, within the context of an established forest. From a substantial mitigation perspective, the view is taken that the maintenance of thecarbon stock of the forest is important, and recognises that beyond a point, carbon stocks may reach a saturation point in the above-ground biomass. Respecting the commercial function of many forests, forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation. However, providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of net-annual increment, the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time. In practical terms, for rehabilitation/restoration of forests, the forest owner will be required to define the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or landscape level. In order to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate, relative to the rotation period, that carbon stocks have been maintained (against baseline) or increased (from baseline). Importantly the performance/demonstration period is linked to the rotation period, but supported through 10-year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel, i.e. that carbon stocks are being maintained or increasing. In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a forest stand from fire or wind-throw, the existing forest management NACE will move to the restoration NACE, and performance will be judged on the basis of the re-establishment of the forest stand and thus carbon stock development over a period of 20-years. Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These include approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level (multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for the investment. Harvesting practices, such as thinning, removals, final fellings, etc. will temporarily reduce the carbon stock and the potential to sequester carbon. However, such forest management activities should be eligible under Taxonomy, as long as SFM practices are in place; and that carbon sinks of above and below ground carbon are maintained or increased, over the rotation period of the forest; or where selective removal of trees is required as part of the forest conservation plan. The rotation period is here defined as the time from seeding, planting or natural regeneration through to the point of harvest.International relevance of the forest Taxonomy It is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance with the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification approaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No Significant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria that varies across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests in the EU94, and around 20% of productive forests globally. 95 Other forests/forest projects (i.e. non-94 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. 95 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019.Alignment with existing legislation In order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider alignment with existing EU legislative instruments. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements align with existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislation provides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where legislation allows for more substantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach to minimise the risk of using forest biomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-national laws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Paris agreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or strengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed in the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article 29 does not require an explicit ‘substantial contribution’ to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, the compliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based, however through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws or management systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks to establish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation can be assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding. Do no significant harm assessment Key environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows: The DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest mitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1). The criteria can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Compliance shall be reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent) as per criterion 3 of the forest mitigation Taxonomy. (2) AdaptationMinimise the use of pesticides and favour alternative approaches or techniques, such as non-chemical alternatives to pesticides, in line with the Directive 2009/128/EC on the sustainable use of pesticides. With exception of occasions that this is needed to control pest and diseases outbreaks. Adapt the use of fertilizers to what is needed to prevent leeching of nutrients to waters.Take well documented and verifiable measures to avoid the use of active ingredients that are listed in the Stockholm Convention, the Rotterdam Convention, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, or that are listed as classification Ia or Ib in the WHO recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard;No conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss or of high conservation value such as grasslands and any high carbon stock area (e.g. peat lands and wetlands), and areas set aside for the restoration of such habitats in line with national legislation96 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal to preserve conservation status for different species is at a scale above the single forest stand. 97 This criterion should be considered in combination with criterion 3 of the mitigation criteria to disclose through a forest management plan (or equivalent).Promote close-to-nature forestry or similar concepts depending on the local requirements and limitations; Select native species or species, varieties, ecotypes and provenance of trees that adequately provide the necessary resilience to climate change, natural disasters and the biotic, pedologic and hydrologic condition of the area concerned, as well as the potential invasive character of the species under local conditions, current and projected climate change.Conservation forest That in which the ‘primary designated management objective’ (FAO FRA definition) is that of conservation. Specifically, those forests where the management objectives are ‘conservation of biodiversity’ or ‘social services’ based on the FAO FRA definitions98.Criterion 1: Mandatory application of the following Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements: o Develop and implement a forest conservation plan that identifies the conservation objectives of the site and the necessary conservation measures. These shall include practices that maintain or increase existing carbon stocks, considering the non-exhaustive list of examples practices under Category C in Annex F2. These should allow for application of other similar approaches, that recognise local specificities and conditions, while maintaining or improving soil quality, and biodiversity in line with conservation objectives; o Do not convert high carbon stock land (i.e. primary forest, peatlands, wetlands, and grasslands) which has this status in or after January 2008; o Harvesting carried out in line with the conservation plan should be undertaken in compliance with the laws in the country of origin99; o Any harvested forest should be regenerated after harvesting and in line with the forest conservation plan. Criterion 2: Establish a verified baseline GHG balance of relevant carbon pools at the beginning of the investment;Criterion 3: Demonstrate continued maintenance and increase of carbon sinks from above-ground carbon over time, supported by and disclosed through a forest conservation plan (or equivalent) at 10-year intervals, that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities.Continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements is demonstrated and continuously disclosed at 10 -year intervals through a forest conservation plan that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 3). The primary management objective of the forest should continue to be conservation – otherwise the forest will be subject to different NACE metrics and thresholds.Verified GHG balance baseline100 is calculated for above-ground carbon pools, based on growth-yield curves for species per m3/year/ha, carbon convertible. Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees. Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide.Above ground Carbon stocks shall be maintained or increased above carbon baseline over time. Changes in carbon stocks should be disclosed based on growth yield curves in 10-year intervals through a forest conservation plan (or equivalent instrument101) that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described in Criteria 2)102.100 Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of planting). The increment based on the growth-yield curves gives the approximate number of how many m3/year/ha is available for increment. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide 101 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal may be to perform at a scale above the single forest stand. Absence of landscape management access will in turn require disclosure at the single forest stand. The Forest Taxonomy leaves to forest owners and companies to explain, document on which level they report. 102 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause: underperformance resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in non-compliance with the Taxonomy criteria.Conservation forests are that in which the ‘primary designated management objective’ (FAO FRA definition) is that of conservation. Specifically, those forests where the management objectives are ‘conservation of biodiversity’ or ‘social services’ based on the FAO FRA definitions103.Box 2: FAO FRA definitions relating to conservation forests 1. PRIMARY DESIGNATED MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE: The primary designated management objective assigned to a management unit. Explanatory notes: a. In order to be considered primary, the management objective should be significantly more important than other management objectives. b. Primary management objectives are exclusive and area reported under one primary management objective should not be reported for any other primary management objectives. c. Nation-wide general management objectives established in national legislation or policies (such as e.g. “all forest land should be managed for production, conservation and social purposes”) should not be considered as management objectives in this context. 2. CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY: Forest where the management objective is conservation of biological diversity. Includes but is not limited to areas designated for biodiversity conservation within the protected areas. Explanatory note: a. Includes wildlife reserves, High Conservation Values, key habitats and forest designated or managed for wildlife habitat protection. 3. SOCIAL SERVICES: Forest where the management objective is social services. Explanatory notes: a. Includes services such as: recreation, tourism, education, research and/or conservation of cultural/spiritual sites. b. Excludes areas for subsistence collection of wood and/or non-wood forest products.The Taxonomy acknowledges a definitional change from ‘conservation forest’ to ‘existing forest management’ if the objectives of the forest management change; or to ‘restoration/rehabilitation’ or ‘reforestation’ should there be the loss of forest from force majeure. The approach taken to determine metrics and thresholds rely on cumulative criteria. Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation and the Taxonomy recognizes that, although the EU has a variety of forest-related policies, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy, and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights, which include a long history of longterm planning in national and regional regulations. The Taxonomy sets out the following qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure a measured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) and permanent. All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are: Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest conservation. SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems’. 106 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), andCriterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growthyield curves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to be maintained or increased and GHG emissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon pools (above and below-ground) as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B. Specifically: (a) above-ground biomass; (b) below-ground biomass; (c) litter; (d) dead wood; (e) soil organic carbon, with the exclusion of (f) harvested wood products in the land accounting categories of afforested land and managed forest land, which is beyond the scope of this Taxonomy. However, it recognises the challenges of belowground carbon measurement. Therefore, the specific criteria used in the fiches focuses on the measurement of above-ground carbon pools only. The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context specific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of maintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forest carbon stocks. Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide.Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criterion 1 as reported through a forest conservation plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10year intervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities. Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall be demonstrated over the duration of the investment Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. These include approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-107 FSC/PEFC estimate that about 54% of forests globally are productive and/or used for multiple purposes, of which 20% are certified by FSC and PEFC. See Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019.area level (multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for the investment. Considering the impact of climate conditions and changing environments the Taxonomy includes a clause for force majeure that states that underperformance resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds - and will not result in non-compliance with the Taxonomy criteria.International relevance of the forest Taxonomy It is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance with the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification approaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No Significant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria that varies across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests in the EU108, and around 20% of productive forests globally. 109 Other forests/forest projects (i.e. non-certified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market with certainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the DNSH criteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (including carbon measurement and performance).Alignment with existing legislation In order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consider alignment with existing EU legislative instruments. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements align with existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislation provides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where legislation allows for more substantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach to minimise the risk of using forest biomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-national laws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Paris agreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or strengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed in the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article 29 does not require an explicit ‘substantial contribution’ to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, the compliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is riskbased, however through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws108 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019. 109 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019.The DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest mitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1). The criteria can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Compliance shall be reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent) as per criterion 3 of the forest mitigation Taxonomy. (2) AdaptationIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented.Minimise the use of pesticides and favour alternative approaches or techniques, such as non-chemical alternatives to pesticides, in line with the Directive 2009/128/EC on the sustainable use of pesticides. With exception of occasions that this is needed to control pest and diseases outbreaks. Adapt the use of fertilizers to what is needed to prevent leeching of nutrients to waters.Take well documented and verifiable measures to avoid the use of active ingredients that are listed in the Stockholm Convention, the Rotterdam Convention, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, or that are listed as classification Ia or Ib in the WHO recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard;No conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss or of high conservation value such as grasslands and any high carbon stock area (e.g. peat lands and wetlands), and areas set aside for the restoration of such habitats in line with national legislationPromote close-to-nature forestry or similar concepts depending on the local requirements and limitations; Select native species or species, varieties, ecotypes and provenance of trees that adequately provide the necessary resilience to climate change, natural disasters and the biotic, pedologic and hydrologic condition of the area concerned, as well as the potential invasive character of the species under local conditions, current and projected climate change.The replacement of GHG intensive materials and energy in the wider economy relies on other sectors to provide fibre for substitution, which implicates demand and response from the forest sector, which currently has only limited recognition in current accounting frameworks (e.g. LULUCF Regulation).Further recognising the role of forest-based products in the wider process of transitioning to the green economy could incentivise the sector in a positive way – generating demand for Taxonomy compliant forestry – and thus deliver cross sector incentives for substantial contribution to mitigation.Exploring the way to introduce an enabling approach could also help ensure that private sector financing of the use of forest-based products is driving towards the use of more sustainable products and production and, importantly, more sustainable end uses.Key challenges Valorisation of the forest-based products contribution in the down-stream sector. The principles of the circular economy look towards the designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. Therefore, forest-based products that have already been used within an economic sector other than forestry should become part of the circular economy and contribute in another sector – with the aim to keep the wood in its material form for as long as possible before disposal and/or energy recovery. This follows the principle of resource efficiency (EU Forest Strategy described it as: using forest resources in a way that minimises the impact on the environment and climate, and prioritising the forest outputs that have higher added-value, create more jobs and contribute to a better carbon balance). This raises a key question as to the point at which the forest-based sector would be recognised for the initial material production (as a means of substantial contribution), and to contribute to substitution in multiple sectors (where the same wood is used) for their decarbonisation.Different Forest NACE. The current proposal for a Forest Taxonomy includes five NACE sector distinctions, Afforestation, Reforestation, Rehabilitation/restoration, Existing Forest Management and Conservation Forests. Would it be necessary to establish a link between the use of wood products in another economy NACE and a specific forest sector NACE? If so, which one as all form part of the forest management system? How would this be done, and what if a product is used in multiple NACE categories (how to count the multiple substitution).Trans NACE reporting, traceability and compliance. The use of forest-based products in one sector of the economy may be supported through a separate investor (say for building regeneration) who is not investing in the forest sector. The forest sector producers, especially the owners mostly do not always know the end-use of the wood products passing beyond the forest gate. However, there would need to be in place some form of traceability and chain of custody to ensure compliance, for example exploring how information from the HWP category in the LULUCF Regulation could be used.Enabling and supply. Do enabling activities by default need to arise from a sector/supply that is taxonomy eligible/compliant in the context of significant contribution? For example, if wood used in construction of a building is recognised as “enabling”, the source of the wood would need to be taxonomy aligned within the forest sector.Multiple enablers. The end use of wood is highly varied, with both different fractions of the wood used in different resource streams, and different products or end uses generated at different stages (Figure 7). How and at what point in the wood flow would “greening by” be defined, or it should be counted at each point when it substitutes non-renewable resources?Opportunities from existing practice Despite the potential challenges to the Taxonomy for including a more holistic approach to the use of wood products in the wider economy, there are a number of cases where operators have been able to develop approaches to tracking or estimating the substation effects and benefits of forest products in the wider economy. These demonstrate proof of concept for a wider applicability of the forest Taxonomy than focussing only on the management of forests up to the forest gate.The TEG has received various documents in this regard, including information provided by Stora Enso and SCA (a Swedish publicly listed forest products company) – both demonstrate the added value (in climate terms) of forest products in the overall economy through substitution effects. The point of contention within the forest sector is that the EU’s accounting of the climate benefits from forestry are notOverall therefore it would seem possible for the forest industry or specific businesses to be able to calculate the substitution effect of forest products arising in the forest sector (as defined in the Taxonomy) but delivering substitution benefits in other economy sectors. The question still remains to which NACE sector the benefits arising from the use of wood should be attributed? The logic of the taxonomy overall suggests that this should still be in the sector that takes the raw material and processes it into something which will deliver substitution, or utilises that material (or energy) in substitute for another. It would seem inappropriate to recognise the felling of trees, i.e. the provision of the raw material as an enabling activity per se. It is recognised, however, that forest-products arise from a renewable resource, rather than the finite resources of the extractive industries.Ideas on a possible enabling approach Within the manufacturing TEG, the Taxonomy already recognises enabling activities. These are recognised on the basis of the principal of “The manufacture of low carbon technologies that result in substantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy (including private households) is eligible.” It is therefore the production of something that would lead to substantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors. In this context, components of renewable energy infrastructure are cited, amongst others. The line between the manufacture of an essential product for decarbonisation and substantial mitigation, is clear. Forest products are slightly different. Wood materials and energy are not necessarily essential components of low-carbon technology, in that a house or furniture is not necessarily low-carbon if it is made from wood. The key identifying feature for wood products is one of substitution, whether another low(er)-carbon product could be used or whether there are other forms of energy (or demand reduction) that would be more carbon beneficial. Therefore, the logical link for ‘greening by’ of the forest sector would need to be able to demonstrate something like the following criteria: In light of the design of the overall Taxonomy (activity based) and the fact that the substitution effect can only be judged in an end-use sector (i.e. at the product level) it is challenging to produce a ‘greening by’ approach that can be implemented through the forest Taxonomy alone. As such, it is proposed that the ‘greening of’ through the use of forest products, is addressed through those sectors that utilise those forest products (i.e. end use or intermediary sectors), such as manufacturing or buildings. Specific recommendations to other Taxonomy sectors (Buildings and Manufacturing) are made in the preamble to the forest Taxonomy, and not repeated here. These can be summarised as follows: Sectors using long-lived wood products should make a subjective view that wood is a prime raw material with climate mitigation benefits, and should be considered with priority for use in the economy. This must be accompanied by robust DNSH criteria to ensure that the demand for forest products does not lead to impacts on the forest resources. The future Taxonomy should ensure that wood used in other sectors to deliver substantial contribution to mitigation, is also compliant with the forest Taxonomy.When considering the development of Circular Economy principles into the Taxonomy, both as DNSH and as substantial contribution, specific consideration should be made to the use of forest products throughout different economic sectors.ANNEX F2 indicative and recommended forest management practices that maintain and/or increase carbon stores or carbon sinks of above and below ground carbon (as per Criterion 1 of the Forest Taxonomy)Indicative examples of types of practices that could be considered for all the relevant carbon pools112. Applicability per activity113 (AF, RE, FR, MF), if not specifically mentioned, practice applies to all.In above-ground biomass Rationale: Enhance structural stability against disturbances due to optimal crown and stem architecture that minimizes the impact of disturbances (storms, pest outbreaks) and associated carbon losses. Use harvesting methods that minimise impacts on soils; Maintain soil organic carbon pool and soil health through continuous cover that contribute to soil moisture and biodiversity. Leave appropriate vegetation and other non-productive species.112 This is a non-exhaustive list of practices that could be used, keeping in mind that all carbon pools identified here need to be addressed. Applicants can develop further practices, if meeting the requirements of the Category. Types of practices always have to be understood depending on the local conditions (temperature, rainfall, soil, altitude, species, etc.). 113 AF – Afforestation, RE – Restoration, RF – Reforestation, MF – Management of existing forest 114 According to LULUCF Regulation Annex I, part B, the carbon pools are: above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood, soil organic carbon. 115 Whole area or a compartment, depending on existing classifications of the forests in the country. 116 Subject to the local conditions and limitation in wildfires prone areas and outbreaks of pests and disease and other natural disturbances. 117 i.e. taking into account potential effect on health and stability of ecosystems, risks of forest fires, etc.In above ground biomass119 Rationale: Enhance structural stability against disturbances due to optimal crown and stem architecture that minimize the impact of disturbances (storms, pest outbreaks) disturbances damage and associated carbon losses. Support carbon stock and/or carbon sequestration increase, alone or in combination with forest resilience. Promote natural regeneration when in line with ecological conditions and stands requirements120 and adopt artificial regeneration only in cases of proved unsuccessful site spread on natural regeneration (MF);Reduce risk of bark beetles or other pest outbreaks through species diversification, support more spatially diverse management that increases tree regeneration speed enhancing of structure complexity;118 On deadwood management in Europe. Vìtkovà L. et al (2018) Deadwood management in Central European forests: Key considerations for practical implementation. Forest Ecology and Management. 119 Practices that increase carbon sequestration are linked only to above-ground and deadwood carbon pools where it is technically feasible to enhance, measure and monitor carbon sequestration 120 Subject to local conditions and legal obligations to control pest outbreaks 120 Subject to the local conditions and limitation in wildfires prone areas and outbreaks of pests and diseaseSelect native species or in exceptional circumstances, species, varieties, ecotypes of trees that adequately provide the best adaptation to the site and resilience to climate change, natural disasters and the biotic, pedologic and hydrologic condition of the area concerned, as well as to the potential invasive character of the species under local conditions, current and projected climate change.Increase the quantity and distribution of standing and ground deadwood (RE, RF, MF); Retain trees with microhabitat, position and arrangement, tree species, size of retained wood, stage of decay121 (RE, RF, MF). Reduce harvest, e.g. as part of non-intervention forest management approaches (where harvest is only possible for safety or phytosanitary reasons); Maintain high carbon stocks in multiple pools while optimizing other non-productive ecosystems benefits (RE, MF); Support species diversity, including ancillary species (AF, RE, RF, MF); (Re-)establish the structure of forests, enhance the natural productivity and native species diversity (RE, RF, MF); Enhance forest species’ composition similar to original or reestablish the productivity and some or all of the species originally present/native species.In deadwood Rationale: Increase the amount of standing and ground deadwood. Approaches such as limited or non-intervention management and conservation forestry are associated with high carbon stocks given that more biomass is left in the forest, rotation lengths are typically increased compared to conventional approaches while non-productive ecosystem services are optimized. Retain trees with microhabitat, position and arrangement, tree species, size of retained wood, stage of decay122 (RE, RF, MF); No or minimal use of pesticides to control pest outbreaks123 and instead favour alternative approaches or techniques, such as nonchemical alternatives to pesticides, in line with the Directive 2009/128/EC on the sustainable use of pesticide.122 On deadwood management in Europe. Vìtkovà L. et al(2018) Deadwood management in Central European forests: Key considerations for practical implementation 123 Subject to local conditions and legal obligations to control pest and disease outbreaksWhy agriculture is addressed in the Taxonomy Agriculture is the management of the natural environment, plants and animals to produce and process food, feed, fibre, fuel and other products. As a sector, it plays a central role in climate change, sustainable development and food security. It is projected that by 2050 the global population will increase to 10 billion, resulting in a 50% increase in the demand for food. However, even at present, the food supply chain contributes 19-29% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the majority of which, for most supply chains, occurs at the farm level (80-90%). In the EU, 10% of GHG emissions are attributed to agriculture.124 This alone presents opportunities for significant climate change mitigation. However, agriculture differs from other sectors when considering climate change mitigation as it can act as both a source and a sink for GHG emissions. Soil carbon and biomass (trees, shrubs and grasslands) are also relevant as major pools of carbon. For this reason, agriculture has the potential to be a net positive sector from an emissions perspective. At the same time, agricultural productivity is simultaneously vulnerable to climate change (including, but not limited to, heat stress, drought, flooding, changes in seasonality and extreme weather events) and central to supporting adaptation and resilience through its provision of ecosystem services and income for billions of households worldwide. Subjects covered The following economic activities are explicitly addressed in the Taxonomy: Growing of perennials: including grapes, tropical and sub-tropical fruits, citrus fruits, stone fruits, other tree and bush fruits and nuts, oleaginous fruits, beverage crops, spices, aromatics and drug and pharmaceutical crops, grass leys;In addition, mixed farming, where combinations of the above activities are carried out on a farm holding, can be addressed via the application of the relevant thresholds and criteria from these same three activities. For the purpose of the Taxonomy, mixed farming involves any operation with both livestock and crop production. Crops grown in mixed farming can be grown either to feed livestock or for separate sale as a cash crop. In assessing mixed farming operations, cropland production should be screened using criteria for growing of non-perennials (e.g. if vineyards or orchards are included) or perennial crops (e.g. if a farm grows cereals). Livestock production should be assessed according to the animal production criteria. It is important to note that recoupling of crops and livestock can lead to greater resource efficiency and reduced reliance on synthetic inputs, thus improving climate and environmentalThe proposed criteria for agricultural production activities have been developed on the basis of enabling systemic transition over time. This has in part been pursued so as to prevent system lock-in whereby an immediate action for mitigation prevents or closes down future options for change that could deliver greater mitigation benefits in the sector. For example, the investment in activities that seek to improve the GHG performance of the livestock sector should not prevent more systemic changes in the sector through, for example, greater integration of livestock and crop production (mixed farming), or overall reduction in livestock production. Another example can be taken from the perspective of the use and production of biofuels for the transport sector. Whilst more sustainable liquid biofuels have allowed GHG emission reductions from transport energy, they perpetuate the use of internal combustion engines in a mitigation development trajectory that may seek more substantial changes, such as electrification of vehicles, or modal shift.Stakeholders raised the option of an alternative, more principles-based approach to setting criteria, based on for example agro-ecological principles. This approach was considered by the working group, but was felt to be too open-ended to enable a set of criteria to be applied consistently by all users, leading to a high risk of significant variation in levels of performance. However, it is the view of the TEG that the criteria (and specifically the best practices detailed here) align with those principles, and allow sufficient flexibility in their application to meet a variety of user circumstances, while at the same time requiring a consistent level of performance across users.A number of stakeholders noted the need for consistency with existing regulation. In response, efforts have been made to reference to existing EU regulation that aligns with these criteria where it exists. This is particularly the case for the ‘do no significant harm’ criteria. As noted above however, that a number of these criteria relating to ‘a substantial contribution to mitigation’ are consistent with, but go beyond, existing regulation.A large number of points of feedback were received on specific best practices. These have been reviewed and considered in depth and changes made to the criteria accordingly following expert consultation. This includes, but is not limited to, addressing emissions embedded in livestock feed, and reconsidering the best practice relating to tillage.Some stakeholders raised concerns around animal welfare and health status. These do not fall under the environmental goals of the Taxonomy at this time and therefore were not within the Agricultural Working Group’s remit. However, a recommendation has been made to the Platform to integrate criteria addressing these factors at the earliest possible date.Lastly, a number of stakeholders raised concerns over the difficulty in demonstrating compliance with these criteria. This challenge is recognised by the working group. To assist in addressing this, the working group has requested that the Platform work with existing agricultural standards, certification schemes, carbon schemes and others to map consistency of requirements between those schemes and these criteria, with the aim of establishing a pool of proxy indicators that can be taken as evidence of compliance with these criteria.All data relates to 2016, unless otherwise stated.

There are a number of known benefits such practices, including increased carbon sequestration, reduced soil erosion and nutrient loss, and via its positive impact on biodiversity, support pollination and pest control. The challenge faced when considering whether a ‘land out of production’ and/or ‘integration of structural elements’ practice should be required is setting an ambitious but implementable target. Relevant questions are: what proportion of land should be covered, how should it be covered, how would this be balanced with other objectives (such as food production) and how could permanence be ensured. Further, given the high cobenefits and inter-relations of such practice across mitigation, biodiversity and general ecosystem health, it is also debatable whether such practices most appropriately fits under substantial contribution to mitigation or substantial contribution to healthy ecosystems. TheSwitching from higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities. For example, reducing cattle numbers and increasing legume production as an alternative source of protein, with a corresponding consumption switch between agricultural commodities. At this time, while livestock production, and in particular ruminant livestock production (beef, lamb and dairy), is a significant source of emissions in the agriculture sector, it is included in the Taxonomy due to the significant short-term mitigation potential associated with reducing emissions intensity in livestock management, and because it is not yet clear what appropriate transition pathways are for livestock production. In the interim, it is appropriate to maximise the significant mitigation potential here, noting the point made above that the best practices for livestock production do not prevent or close down further opportunities that might deliver greater mitigation opportunities in the sector. However, it is noted that for absolute emissions from agriculture to continue decreasing beyond a certain point and to move towards net-zero targets by mid-century, reduced emissions intensity will need to be coupled as soon as possible with commensurate changes in consumption patterns and overall reduced per-capita consumption of livestock products, especially certain beef, lamb and dairy products.129 This implies both societal changes in terms of changing diets and reducing food waste, as well as structural transformations in the agricultural sector. Significant and coordinated policy efforts will be required to manage both consumer behavioural changes and to incentivise and manage structural change in the agri-food supply chain. Future Taxonomy updates should, however, consider what rates of meat consumption and/or practices for production are compatible with a zero-carbon economyMore granular actions can deliver significant mitigation, but not at a sufficient level to be recognised as making a substantial contribution to climate mitigation at the level of the economic activity as a whole. They can also be a significant portion of lending portfolios for some investors and so it is essential to develop appropriate criteria for them. These measures or actions might include addressing energy or resource efficiency or land management through: oThere is consensus in the scientific community that climate neutrality requires dietary shifts, which will also have significant public health benefits. For example, in the EU, energy and protein intake levels are higher than recommended – for protein by as high as 70% per capita compared to WHO guidelines.The proposed Taxonomy criteria and practices for agriculture have been developed on the basis of enabling systemic change, rather than focusing on individual ‘fixes’ to the mitigation challenge. The proposed practices consider implications beyond mitigation alone and seek, where possible to support contribution to the wider environmental and climate adaptation objectives of the Taxonomy Regulation. This work should be developed further. The Platform should draw on existing and emerging evidence to consider further not just how substantial mitigation can be pursued without causing significant harm to other objectives, but rather to pursue approaches that further optimize synergies and minimize trade-offs between significant contribution to mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity, water, and soil management. This also includes improved consideration of how the benefits of mixed farming systems can better be captured in the Taxonomy.In addition, livestock production comprises a broad range of practices, including intensive and landless operations, which can have particular environmental impacts beyond GHG emissions. There were insufficient resources to analyse the current evidence base in depth in order to allow for a differentiated treatment of different forms of livestock production from a DNSH angle and it is recommended that the Platform look into this further.Although animal welfare and health status and the side-effects of antibiotic use in the livestock sector are currently not part of the DNSH criteria as they do not fall under the environmental goals prioritised at this time, the stakeholder consultation, as well as available research130 shows that these are significant societal expectations associated with livestock production 131. As such, a recommendation to the Platform is that criteria addressing animal welfare and health are integrated at the earliest possible date.E.g. http://www.risefoundation.eu/images/files/2018/2018_RISE_LIVESTOCK_FULL.pdf “Whatever level of EU livestock production, now and in the future, it is essential that continued progress is made on four fronts: improving resource efficiency, reducing leakages into the environment, increasing the health status and welfare of farmed animals, and minimising the use of antibiotics.” 130What guidance would be necessary to support land managers in implementing the criteria and practices set out in the Taxonomy so as to realise synergies and avoid trade-offs between objectives. This would lay the ground-work for the Taxonomy as it evolves from DNSH to substantial contribution across all environmental objectives. The platform is asked to consider two elements in this regard: oHow and whether it is appropriate to deliver country or regionally tailored advice regarding the applicability of each best practice listed in that localised context. Whilst most best practices are generic in nature and set out the main approaches to delivering a substantial contribution to mitigation in agriculture, the global reach of the Taxonomy naturally means that some practices in temperate regions may not be as applicable in sub-tropical areas, etc.; To consider how and what guidance could be provided and by whom, to allow those implementing the practices for substantial mitigation to do so in a way that benefits other environmental objectives and/ or simultaneously ensures no significant harm to other environmental objectives. For example, the sowing of catch and cover crops is likely to deliver significant contribution to water quality objectives by stabilising soils in periods of high run-off, preventing silting and the movement of nutrients to water bodies. Advice could be framed around the location, within a farm, where such practices would deliver particular benefits to water quality, such as in high nutrient load areas, on slopes, and areas adjacent to water bodies. To assist with this, the TEG has included indictors in the best practice tables to identify which best practices have potential co-benefits with the other environmental goals of the Taxonomy.A large number of carbon audit tools are available at present, although there is variation in the coverage and robustness of these tools. A recent review132 conducted in Scotland identified three tools deemed technically very suitable for farm-level carbon audits in the Scottish context, enabling sufficient robustness, comprehensiveness and clarity of documentation: Cool Farm Tool133, Scottish AgRE Calculator134, and JRC Carbon calculator135. At least the Cool Farm Tool and JRC Carbon Calculator are also more broadly applicable in the EU. The FAO-Ex-act tool might also be appropriate to use. It would be valuable if the Platform could provide guidance on appropriate tools for demonstrating compliance and support further development of the existing tools to address capacity building and compliance checking needs associated with a transition to low-carbon farming.Leinonen, I., V. Eory, M. MacLeod, A. Sykes, K. Glenk and R. Rees (2019). “Comparative analysis of farm-based carbon audits.” Report for ClimateXChange Scotland. https://www.climatexchange.org.uk/media/3584/farm-based-carbon-audits-final.pdf 132Similarly, the Platform is requested to consider whether and which existing sustainability standards, carbon credit schemes, standards, certification schemes or similar could be used as proxy indicators for compliance with these criteria and thresholds, subject to meeting the same performance outcomes. This includes engaging to align those standards or certification schemes if needed. The adoption of such proxy indicators would help substantially in the cost-effective demonstration of compliance with these criteria and thresholds.Likewise, efforts have been made to cross reference these criteria to the post-2020 CAP for EU users. This is a work in progress made complicated by the fact that the post-2020 CAP has not been adopted at this time. The Platform is, therefore, requested to review the provisions of the post 2020 CAP when finalised and consider whether any changes would need to be made to these Criteria based on that.As currently proposed, in the main, the Criteria apply equally to, and do not distinguish between, smaller and large scale farms. This seems appropriate in terms of seeking to address emissions reductions and sequestration in farms of all sizes to maximise aggregate impact, recognising that small farms can be some of the most inefficient and emitting, and large firms can be some of the most efficient per unit of output, and vice versa. However, the Platform is asked to consider whether differences should be made in terms of the requirements to demonstrate compliance, recognising the higher transaction cost impacts for smaller scale farmers. o As noted above, the TEG are of the view that these criteria and thresholds have global applicability, based on input from TEG members and expert advisers with global expertise and experience. However, additional global consultation will be needed to confirm the appropriateness of these proposals for crop and livestock production around the world. 5. To keep these criteria up-to-date, the Platform is asked to:  6. Lastly, as noted above, these criteria focus on the significant mitigation potential that can be realised in the way these crops and resources are produced, regardless of their end use. They do not take into account any contribution that agricultural products can make to mitigation via the bioeconomy. The Platform is asked to consider this aspect further to determine whether and under what circumstances alternative criteria for (some) agricultural production or producers might be appropriate in light of potential substantial contributions they can enable in downstream economic activities that are part of the bioeconomy.Both of the principles set out here must be fulfilled: 1. Demonstrate substantial avoidance or reduction of GHG emissions from production and related practices; and 2. Maintain existing sinks and increase sequestration (up to saturation point) in above- and below-ground carbon stocks.1) Avoid or reduce GHG emissions (including those from inputs used on the farm) through the application of appropriate management practices. This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways: -3) Production is not undertaken on land that had any of the following status in or after January 2008 and no longer has that status.136 a) Wetlands, namely land that is covered with or saturated by water permanently or for a significant part of the year; b) Continuously forested areas, namely land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of more than 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ; c) Land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of between 10 % and 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ 137; d) Peatland, unless evidence is provided that the cultivation and harvesting of that raw material does not involve drainage of previously undrained soil.This requirement is taken from RED II, Article 29, paragraphs 4 and 5. It is be applied to all perennial crop production, whether for biofuels, bioliquids or biomass, or for food or feed uses. The intention is per RED II, namely to ensure high carbon stock land is not converted for the purposes for agricultural production. 137Unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology of part C of Annex V of RED II is applied, the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of RED II would be fulfilled.The essential management practices are described in the table below. All essential practices will need to be deployed, except where particular practices can be demonstrated to be not applicable to that farm holding given the particular biophysical conditions at that farm holding.In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment, this assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with production, as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use (see below for relevant GHG categories). If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may be omitted in the first instance. The assessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period. The assessment is a self-assessment using an appropriate tool, no independent audit or verification of the GHG assessment is required.To demonstrate compliance with all other essential practices, it will be necessary to establish a farm sustainability management plan which describes the management practices being deployed - taking into account crop husbandry requirements, farm pedo-climatic conditions - and their coverage on the farm. To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools.To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds it will be necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emission baseline for the farm (see below for relevant GHG categories). It will be against such baseline data that emission reductions of Carbon increases can be measured. A carbon audit is necessary in order to also assess where action is needed, and this must be accompanied by a carbon management plan to set out the management practices that will deliver the GHG emissions reduction/ carbon sequestration. This carbon management plan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan.Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years, to show broad compliance with the requirement for carbon stocks to increase progressively over a 20 year period, assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbon sequestration trends. It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger 114Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levels should include the following, though it is recognised that in practice, the scope of GHG counted will be subject to the technical capabilities of the GHG accounting tools being used: oIn the case of force majeure: emissions resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not affect the application of these requirements or result in non-compliance with these criteria.Prevent soil compaction (frequency and timing of field operations should be planned to avoid traffic on wet soil; tillage operation should be avoided or strongly reduced on wet soils; stock density should be reduced to avoid compaction, especially on wet soils).Nutrient management plan to optimize fertilization and improve nitrogen use efficiency. The plan should be based on soil testing, estimating of crops nutrient requirements, recording of nutrient applications, considering field characteristics and soil type, estimating soil nitrogen supply, andWhere energy emissions represent greater than 20% of total emissions from non-perennial crop production activity, these emissions should be reduced appropriately for the term of the investment, in line with the trajectory outlined on P11 i.e. by at least 10% compared to a 2020 baseline for a 5 year investment period, 20% compared to a 2020 baseline for a 10 year investment period to 2030, and 30% compared to a 2020 baseline for a 20 year investment period – with pro-rata adjustments for investments of intermediate durationsRationale Opportunities for substantial mitigation and contributions to a net zero carbon economy An overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determine whether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation, consistent with the underlying goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050. In the context of agriculture, Net-Zero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot be reduced to zero, they can be compensated for through increased removals (through carbon sequestration) on farmed land. The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) be 117Approach taken to setting thresholds for this economic activity There continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ ha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if such information existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds for implementation would remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice. However, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e) is possible, where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or project. Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance, it is a relatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might previously have been achieved and if the farm is already delivering significant mitigation. Therefore, it is harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X% reduction in emissions than it is for a form that currently performs relatively poorly. Furthermore, to determine compliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at farm level is necessary. However, this is not yet mainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches. The proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deployment of specific bundles of management practices, that are recognised as essential to delivering low carbon production in agriculture. This more qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor, and there are existing mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a more directly communicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the ground. As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well as those that will additional investment finance to do so, it also allows for the recognition of farms (and associated assets 118Metrics and thresholds for this economic activity On management practices that deliver substantial mitigation Rationale for the selection of practices: Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possible mitigation practices available in the agricultural sector to address the different emissions and opportunities for sequestration in perennial cropland management. For the purpose of establishing criteria and thresholds which identify when the economic activity of perennial cropland delivers substantial mitigation, individual management practices were identified for which: 1) there is sufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects and interactions with other environmental and food security objectives; and 2) the scale, certainty and consistency of mitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated (for example, Smith et al. 2008140, Paustian et al. 2016141, Kay et al. 2019142). These management practices have been demonstrated to improve soil health and soil productivity so as to secure agricultural yields and thus reduce the emission intensity of crop production – outcomes critical for the delivery of substantial mitigation - and/ or reduce the carbon intensity of agriculture, and also do not risk leakage effects. They also do not risk negative ancillary effects nor are in conflict with legislationOn GHG emission reduction thresholds Substantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net negative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) to varying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions from the agriculture sector as a whole or perennial crop production specifically the degree to which emission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need. It is also noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of ‘substantial’ should be consistent in the global context.Wollenberg, E., Richards, M., Smith, P., Havlík, P., Obersteiner, M., Tubiello, F.

Guidance should be sought from the relevant competent national or regional authority to identify areas or issues of importance and relevance within the area or project concerned. DNSH ObjectiveIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented.Activities should minimise raw material use per unit of output, including energy through increased resource use efficiency147. Activities should minimise the loss of nutrients (in particular nitrogen and phosphate) leaching out from the production system into the environment. 148Consistent with GAEC 5 of Annex III of COM(2018)392. The aim is to provide farmers with a digital tool that helps them optimize the use of nutrients on their farm leading to environmental and agronomic benefits.Activities ensure that nutrients (fertilisers) and plant protection products (e.g. pesticides and herbicides) are targeted in their application (in time and area treated) and are delivered at appropriate levels (with preference to sustainable biological, physical or other non-chemical methods if possible) and with appropriate equipment and techniques to reduce risk and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment (e.g. water and air pollution) and the loss of excess nutrients.151 The use only of plant protection products with active substances that ensure high protection of human and animal health and the environment. 152 Activities ensure the protection of soils, particularly over winter, to prevent erosion and run-off into water courses/bodies and to maintain soil organic matter.153 Activities do not lead to the conversion, fragmentation or unsustainable intensification of high-nature-value land, wetlands, forests, or other areas of high-biodiversity value154. This includes highly biodiverse grassland spanning more than one hectare that is: i) natural, namely grassland that would remain grassland in the absence of human intervention and that maintains the natural species composition and ecological characteristics and processes; or ii) non-natural, namely grassland that would cease to be grassland in the absence of human intervention and that is species-rich and not degraded and has been identified as being highly biodiverse by the relevant competent authority. Activities should not155:149 It is noted that the EU Circular Economy Strategy and many of the actions from the corresponding actions plans have relevance to agriculture that may provide guidance here (e.g. proposing legislation setting minimum requirements for reused water for agricultural irrigation, new Fertiliser Regulation introducing harmonised rules for organic fertilisers manufactured from secondary raw materials such as agricultural by-products and bio-wastes. 150 See also National Emission Ceilings Directive (EU) 2016/2284 (notably Annex III, part 2), and the related provisions in the National Air Pollution Control Programme, established by each Member State under this Directive. 151 See Directive 2009/128/EC on sustainable use of pesticides and the Nitrates Directive. SMR 13 of CAP post 2020 will link the implementation of the pesticide directive with direct payments under cross compliance, 152 In the EU, this means the use of plant protection products that are categorised in groups 1, 2 or 3 as regard their hazard weighting under Directive (EU) 2019/782 (table1). 153 Consistent with GAECs 6 & 7 of Annex III of COM(2018)392 154 Areas of high-biodiversity-value can be defined as set out in Article 29(3) of the Directive EU(2018)2001 155 Consistent with Statutory Management Directive 3 and 4 of the post 2020 CAP and specifically Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna (OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7): Article 6(1) and (2) and Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds (OJ L 20, 26.1.2010, p. 7): Article 3(1), Article 3(2)(b), Article 4(1), (2) and (4)Where activities involve the production of novel non-native or invasive alien species, their cultivation should be subject to an initial risk assessment and ongoing monitoring in order to ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent escape to the environment.Both of the principles set out here must be fulfilled: 1. Demonstrate substantial avoidance or reduction of GHG emissions from production and related practices; and 2. Maintain existing sinks and increase sequestration (up to saturation point) in above- and below-ground carbon stocks.1) Avoid or reduce GHG emissions (including those from inputs used on the farm) through the application of appropriate management practices. This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways: -The essential management practices are deployed consistently over the applicable non-perennial crop production area each year OR Reduction in GHG emissions (gCO2e) for the area of non-perennial production, in line with the following trajectory:3) Production is not undertaken on land that had any of the following status in or after January 2008 and no longer has that status. 156 a) Wetlands, namely land that is covered with or saturated by water permanently or for a significant part of the year b) Continuously forested areas, namely land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of more than 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ; c) Land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of between 10 % and 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ; 157 d) Peatland, unless evidence is provided that the cultivation and harvesting of that raw material does not involve drainage of previously undrained soil.This requirement is taken from RED II, Article 29, paragraphs 4 and 5. It is be applied to all perennial crop production, whether for biofuels, bioliquids or biomass, or for food or feed uses. The intention is per RED II, namely, to ensure high carbon stock land is not converted for the purposes for agricultural production. 157Unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology of part C of Annex V of RED II is applied, the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of RED II would be fulfilled.In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment, this assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with production, as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use (see below for relevant GHG categories). If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may be omitted in the first instance. The assessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period. The assessment is a selfassessment using an appropriate tool, no independent audit or verification of the GHG assessment is required.To demonstrate compliance with all other essential practices, it will be necessary to establish a farm sustainability management plan which describes the management practices being deployed - taking into account crop husbandry requirements, farm pedo-climatic conditions and their coverage on the farm. To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools.To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds it will be necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emission baseline for the farm (see below for relevant GHG categories). It will be against such baseline data that emission reductions of Carbon increases can be measured. A carbon audit is necessary in order to also assess where action is needed, and this must be accompanied by a carbon management plan to set out the management practices that will deliver the GHG emissions reduction/ carbon sequestration. This carbon management plan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan.Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years, to show broad compliance with the requirement for carbon stocks to increase progressively over a 20 year period, assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbon sequestration trends. It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger stage crops with a potential fallow/ restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and some emissions. With this in mind, the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks and/ or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations.Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levels should include the following, though it is recognised that in practice, the scope of GHG counted will be subject to the technical capabilities of the GHG accounting tools being used: 128In the case of force majeure: emissions resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not affect the application of these requirements or result in non-compliance with these criteria.Sowing of cover/catch crops using a locally appropriate species mixture with at least 1 legume and reducing bare soil to the point of having a living plant coverage index of at least 75% at farm level per year.Prevent soil compaction (frequency and timing of field operations should be planned to avoid traffic on wet soil; tillage operation should be avoided or strongly reduced on wet soils; stock density should be reduced to avoid compaction, especially on wet soils; controlled traffic planning can be used). For best long-term results, drainage assessment and improvements needed to be carried out regularly).Nutrient management plan to optimize fertilization and improve nitrogen use efficiency. The plan should be based on soil testing, estimating of crops nutrient requirements, recording of nutrient applications, considering field characteristics and soil type, estimating soil nitrogen supply, and where applicable analysis of manure nutrient content prior to application.In addition, it is required that a low emission Napplication technology is used (e.g. slurry injection, incorporating manure in the soil within 2 hours of spreading) and fertilizer spreaders which have low coefficient of variation (synthetic fertilizer andWhere energy emissions represent more than 20% of total emissions from non-perennial crop production activity, these emissions should be appropriately for the term of the investment, in line with the trajectory outlined on P11 i.e. by at least 10% compared to a 2020 baseline for a 5 year investment period, 20% compared to a 2020 baseline for a 10 year investment period to 2030, and 30% compared to a 2020 baseline for a 20 year investment period – with pro-rata adjustments for investments of intermediate durations.Rationale Opportunities for substantial mitigation and contributions to a net zero carbon economy An overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determine whether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation, consistent with the overarching goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050. In the context of agriculture, Net-Zero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot be reduced to zero, they can be compensated for through increased removals (through carbon sequestration) on farmed land. The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) be met solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on an individual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, it 131Approach taken to setting thresholds for this economic activity There continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ ha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if such information existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds for implementation, would remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice implementation. However, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e/ ha or % change in gCO2e/unit of production) is possible, where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or project. Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance, it is a relatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might previously have been achieved and if the farm is already delivering significant mitigation. Therefore, it is harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X% reduction in emissions than it is for a farm that currently performs relatively poorly. Furthermore, to determine compliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at the farm level is necessary. However, this is not yet mainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches. The proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deployment of specific bundles of management practices, which are recognised as essential to delivering low carbon production in agriculture. This more qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor, and there are existing mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a more directly communicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the ground. As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well as those that will require additional investment finance to do so, it also allows for the recognition of farms (and associated assets and equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHGMetrics and thresholds for this economic activity On management practices that deliver substantial mitigation Rationale for the selection of practices: Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possible management practices available in the agricultural sector to address the different emissions and opportunities for sequestration in non-perennial cropland management. For the purpose of establishing criteria and thresholds which identify when the economic activity of non-perennial cropland delivers substantial mitigation, individual management practices were identified for which: 1) there is sufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects and interactions with other environmental and food security objectives; and 2) the scale, certainty and consistency of mitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated (for example, Smith et al. 2008 160, Paustian et al. 2016161, Kay et al. 2019162). These management practices have been demonstrated to improve soil health and soil productivity so as to secure agricultural yields and thus reduce the emission intensity of crop production – outcomes critical for the delivery of substantial mitigation. The selected practices include reducing the carbon intensity of agriculture, and also do not risk leakage effects. They also do not risk negative ancillary160 Smith, P. et al. (2008), “Greenhouse gas mitigation in agriculture”, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, Vol. 363, Issue 1495, The Royal Society, London, 789-813. 161 Paustian K, Lehmann J, Ogle S, ReayD, RobertsonGP and Smith P 2016 "Climate-smart soils", Nature 532 49–57 162 Kay et al. (2019). "Agroforestry creates carbon sinks whilst enhancing the environment in agricultural landscapes in Europe", Land Use Policy 83 581-593.On GHG emission reduction thresholds Substantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net negative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) to varying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions from the agriculture sector as a whole or non-perennial crop production specifically, the degree to which emission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need. It is also noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of ‘substantial’ should be consistent in the global context.163 Wollenberg, E., Richards, M., Smith, P., Havlík, P., Obersteiner, M., Tubiello, F.

This provides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstrated for this criterion.Note that areas of environmental risk are highly geographically variable. Guidance should be sought from the relevant competent national or regional authority to identify areas or issues of importance and relevance within the area or project concerned. DNSH ObjectiveIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented.Consistent with GAEC 5 of Annex III of COM(2018)392. The aim is to provide farmers with a digital tool that helps them optimize the use of nutrients on their farm leading to environmental and agronomic benefits.Activities ensure that nutrients (fertilisers) and plant protection products (e.g. pesticides and herbicides) are targeted in their application (in time and area treated) and are delivered at appropriate levels (with preference to sustainable biological, physical or other non-chemical methods if possible) and with appropriate equipment and techniques to reduce risk and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment (e.g. water and air pollution) and the loss of excess nutrients. 170Activities do not lead to the conversion, fragmentation or unsustainable intensification of high-nature-value farmland, wetlands, forests, or other areas of high-biodiversity value172. This includes highly biodiverse grassland spanning more than one hectare that is: i) natural, namely grassland that would remain grassland in the absence of human intervention and that maintains the natural species composition and ecological characteristics and processes; or ii) non-natural, namely grassland that would cease to be grassland in the absence of human intervention and that is species-rich and not degraded and has been identified as being highly biodiverse by the relevant competent authority. Activities should not173:169 It is noted that the EU Circular Economy Strategy and many of the actions from the corresponding actions plans have relevance to agriculture that may provide guidance here (e.g. proposing legislation setting minimum requirements for reused water for agricultural irrigation, new Fertiliser Regulation introducing harmonised rules for organic fertilisers manufactured from secondary raw materials such as agricultural by-products and bio-wastes. 170 See Directive 2009/128/EC on sustainable use of pesticides and the Nitrates Directive. SMR 13 of CAP post 2020 will link the implementation of the pesticide directive with direct payments under cross compliance, 171 In the EU, this means the use of plant protection products that are categorised in groups 1, 2 or 3 as regard their hazard weighting under Directive (EU) 2019/782 (table1). 172 Areas of high-biodiversity-value can be defined as set out in Article 29(3) of the Directive EU(2018)2001 173 Consistent with Statutory Management Directive 3 and 4 of the post 2020 CAP and specifically Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna (OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7): Article 6(1) and (2) and Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds (OJ L 20, 26.1.2010, p. 7): Article 3(1), Article 3(2)(b), Article 4(1), (2) and (4)Where activities involve the production of novel non-native or invasive alien species, their cultivation should be subject to an initial risk assessment and on-going monitoring in order to ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent escape to the environment.1. Demonstrate substantial avoidance or reduction of GHG emissions from livestock production (including animal management, storage and processing of manure and slurry, and management of permanent grasslands) 2. Maintain existing sinks and increase sequestration (up to saturation point) of carbon in permanent grassland. Where livestock production does not include permanent grassland, only principle 1 applies. Permanent grassland is land used to grow grasses or other herbaceous forage, either naturally (self-seeded including 'rough grazing') or through cultivation (sown), and which is more than five years old.1) Avoid or reduce GHG emissions (including those from inputs used on the farm) through the application of appropriate management practices. This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways: -2) Maintain and increase existing carbon stocks for a period equal to or greater than 20 years through the application of appropriate management practices. This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways: -3) Production is not undertaken on land that had any of the following status in or after January 2008 and no longer has that status. 174 a) Wetlands, namely land that is covered with or saturated by water permanently or for a significant part of the year;This requirement is taken from RED II, Article 29, paragraphs 4 and 5. It is be applied to all perennial crop production, whether for biofuels, bioliquids or biomass, or for food or feed uses. The intention is per RED II, namely, to ensure high carbon stock land is not converted for the purposes for agricultural production.The essential management practices are described in the table below. All essential practices will need to be deployed, except where particular practices can be demonstrated to be not applicable to that farm holding given the particular biophysical conditions at that farm holding.In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment, this assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with production, as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use (see below for relevant GHG categories). If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may be omitted in the first instance. The assessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period. The assessment is a self-assessment using an appropriate tool, no independent audit or verification of the GHG assessment is required.To demonstrate compliance with all other essential practices, it will be necessary to establish a farm sustainability management plan which describes the management practices being deployed - taking into account crop husbandry requirements, farm pedo-climatic conditions - and their coverage on the farm. To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools.Unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology of part C of Annex V of RED II is applied, the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of RED II would be fulfilled.To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds it will be necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emission baseline for the farm (see below for relevant GHG categories). It will be against such baseline data that emission reductions of Carbon increases can be measured. A carbon audit is necessary in order to also assess where action is needed, and this must be accompanied by a carbon management plan to set out the management practices that will deliver the GHG emissions reduction/ carbon sequestration. This carbon management plan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan.Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levels should include the following, though it is recognised that in practice, the scope of GHG counted will be subject to the technical capabilities of the GHG accounting tools being used: oIn the case of force majeure: emissions resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not affect the application of these requirements or result in non-compliance with these criteria.Better health planning and management (develop a health management plan, improve hygiene & supervision at parturition, improve maternal nutrition in late gestation to increase offspring survival, improve fertility management, selection for improving both methane and ammonia emission efficiency).Feed additives: certain compounds, such as dietary fats, nitrate, 3-NOP, can reduce enteric CH4 emissions of ruminants. They need to be administered by mixed into the feed, and the dosage needs to be set accurately in order to avoid some potential negative health effects on the livestock. It is usually not feasible to apply these for the periods when the livestock is grazing.Precision and multi-phase feeding techniques, where the nutrient requirements of groups of animals (or individual animals) are targeted in feed formulation. This can reduce nitrogen excretion and subsequent N2O emissions from manure, and also increase feed efficiency in general (reducing the feed related upstream emissions).Cooling of liquid manure. CH4 emissions from liquid manure increase with temperature. The slurry can be stored at a lower (ambient) temperature by using animal houses where the manure is collected in an outside pit rather than in the house.This would require that where imported or ‘bought-in’ from outside the region, that it is drawn from certified feed supply chains. For example, the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) provides certification for production and for chain of custody (traceability through the supply chain). Other certification for other crops/ feedstocks standards exists. 176Covering and sealing slurry and farm-yard manure storage to reduce gaseous losses of ammonia (and related indirect N2O) and also CH4 emissions. A wide choice of technological solutions is available from short lifetime plastic film covers to retrofitted or purpose built rigid covers.Separating solids from slurry: via mechanical or chemical ways the liquid part (rich in N) of the slurry (and also digestate from AD) can be separated from the solid part (rich in phosphorous and volatile solids).Slurry acidification is achieved by adding strong acids to the slurry to achieve a pH of 4.5-6.8 – this reduces CH4 and NH3 emissions considerably. There are three main types of technology based on the stage at which the acid is added to the slurry: in the livestock house, in the storage tank, or before field application. The slurry tank and the spreading equipment needs to be designed to withstand the acidic liquid, and precautions particularly while handling the strong acids are needed to minimize the risk of accidents. A better monitoring of the storage is also advisable to reduce the risk of slurry spillage to a minimum.Where energy emissions represent more than 20% of total emissions from livestock production activity, these emissions should be reduced appropriately for the term of the investment, in line with the trajectory outlined on P11 i.e. by at least 10% compared to a 2020 baseline for a 5 year investment period, 20% compared to a 2020 baseline for a 10 year investment period to 2030, and 30% compared to a 2020 baseline for a 20 year investment period – with pro-rata adjustments for investments of intermediate durations.Rationale Opportunities for substantial mitigation and contributions to a net zero carbon economy An overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determine whether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation, consistent with the underlying goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050.In the context of agriculture, Net-Zero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot be reduced to zero, they can be compensated for through increased removals (through carbon sequestration) on farmed land. The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) be met solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on an individual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, it may be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas, would struggle to reach net-zero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country. This raises the question as to the extent to which a given farm, or aggregation of farms, could reach net-zero andApproach taken to setting thresholds for livestock production There continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ ha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if such information existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds would remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice implementation. However, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e/ ha or % change in gCO2e/unit of production) is possible, where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or project. Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance, it is a relatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might previously have been achieved and farm is already delivering significant mitigation. Therefore, is harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X% reduction in emissions than it is for a form that currently performs relatively poorly. Furthermore, to determine compliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at farm level is necessary. But this is not yet mainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches.Metrics and thresholds On management practices that deliver substantial mitigation Rationale for the selection of practices: Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possible mitigation activities available in livestock production to address the different emissions and opportunities for sequestration.Chadwick, D., Sommer, S., Thorman, R., Fangueiro, D., Cardenas, L., Amon, B. and Misselbrook, T. (2011) Manure management: Implications for greenhouse gas emissions. Animal Feed Science and Technology 166-67, 514-531. 181Misselbrook, T. H., Cardenas, L. M., Camp, V., Thorman, R. E., Williams, J. R., Rollett, A. J. and Chambers, B. J. (2014) An assessment of nitrification inhibitors to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from UK agriculture. Environmental Research Letters 9, 115006.On GHG emission reduction thresholds Substantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net negative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) to varying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions from the agriculture sector as a whole or non-perennial crop production specifically the degree to which emission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need. It is also noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of ‘substantial’ should be consistent in the global context. A review by Wollenberg et al, 2016185 suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between 0.9 – 1.4 GtCO2e (in 2030) to meet the 2 °C target, 1 GtCO2e (in 2030). This was selected as an approximate target. These figures relate primarily to non-CO2 emissions and are “an annualized”, not cumulative, goal. The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 6.15–7.78 GtCO2e yr-1 for agriculture in 2030. The goal represents an 11–18% reduction relative to the scenarios’ respective 2030 business as usual baselines”186. As these figures represent non-CO2 emissions they implicitly do not recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals. As such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 has been proposed as ‘significant contribution’ in the context of the Taxonomy. This is supported by work from Frank et al (2018)187, and The IPCC’s fourth assessment report (Smith et al, 2007) 188. In terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture, the work by Wollenberg et al (2016) calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to 2100. The emissions curve (level of emissions over time) increases and decreases at different points, relative to existing efforts, projected changes in external factors, etc. The average reduction figure needed over this whole timeframe is 28% emission reductions compared to the baseline. As we move towards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases, and this implications for any threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe. The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger (approximately a doubling). Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linear between the years, for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20% reduction byWollenberg, E., Richards, M., Smith, P., Havlík, P., Obersteiner, M., Tubiello, F. N.,  Campbell, B. M. (2016). Reducing emissions from agriculture to meet the 2°C target. Global Change Biology, 22, 3859–3864. doi:10.1111/gcb.13340 186Stefan Frank et al, Agricultural non-CO2 emission reduction potential in the context of the 1.5 °C target, Nature Climate Change (2018). DOI: 10.1038/s41558-018-0358-8 Smith, P. et al. (2007), “Agriculture”, in Climate Change 2007: Mitigation, Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge University Press, New York. 188On setting Carbon stock thresholds Setting a universal (or global) absolute threshold (in terms of tC/ ha) for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration and stocking potential – which is very context specific. Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration in line with a universal, absolute threshold. Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions (based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site) is not possible as at present is it is impractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential (i.e. saturation point) of a specific area. Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type, and therefore are not truly context specific. Furthermore, even defining a specific % of carbon increase required is more challenging than setting the relative threshold for reducing emissions. Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level of emissions at a given point, therefore a 20% reduction can be expected to deliver a ‘substantial’ contribution from an underperforming farm (resulting in high overall emission reductions). However, the premise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural land as there is relatively little evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock increase would be needed on agricultural land in a 1.5 or 2°C climate stabilisation target scenario, as this is relative to the level of emissions from that same land (if one is pursuing a net-zero approach) or the level of carbon sequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy. It is however, recognised that C sequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector at global scale, while emission savings of non-CO2 emissions may be more important in the EU with a prevailing intensive production system. Smith et al (2007) estimate that 89% of the technical potential of emission reductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration, i.e.in reducing net CO2 emissions from farming practices and management, including cropland management, grazing land management, restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration of degraded lands.On no conversion of high carbon stock land A cut-off date of 2008 for no conversion of high carbon stock land is chosen to be consistent with the operation of the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria relative to these land types. This provides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstrated for this criterion.On demonstrating compliance with these criteria and thresholds 3-year compliance checking is proposed to ensure progress is being made and mitigation is being delivered in practice, and also to reduce the burden necessary on operators. This compliance checking is required for management practice checking, C stock change and GHG reductions. To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools. Advisory support will likely be required in the process of preparing the plan and may also be required to ensure adequate implementation of the plan Do no significant harm assessment The activity livestock production captures a distinct set of sub-activities that would include intensive and extensive forms of livestock rearing, as well as the management of permanent grassland. These come with different key environmental aspects that need to be considered for investments in this sector, summarised as follows: To note that areas of environmental risk are highly geographically variable. Guidance should be sought from the relevant competent national or regional authority to identify areas or issues of importance and relevance within the area or project concerned. (2) AdaptationIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented. 152Activities should use residues and by-products and take any other measures to minimise primary raw material use per unit of output, including energy189. Activities should minimise the loss of nutrients from the production system into the environment.Activities ensure that nutrients (fertilisers) and plant protection products (e.g. pesticides and herbicides) are targeted in their application (in time and area treated) and are delivered at appropriate levels (with preference to sustainable biological, physical or other non-chemical methods if possible) to reduce risk and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment (e.g. water and air pollution) and the loss of excess nutrients through leaching, volatilisation or oxidisation.190The use only of plant protection products with active substances that ensure high protection of human and animal health and the environment.191Ensure emissions to air, water and soil are within the BATAEL ranges / are prevented or reduced by using a combination of BAT techniques as set out in the BREF for the Intensive Rearing of Poultry or Pigs 192, and by using similar emission reducing techniques for dairy farming;Ensure that mitigation and emission reduction techniques for feeding and housing of livestock and for manure storage and processing are applied, as recommended in the UNECE Framework Code for Good Agricultural Practice for Reducing Ammonia;Where manure is applied to the land, activities should comply with the limit of 170kg nitrogen application per hectare per year, or alternatively, the derogated threshold where one has been set in that member state 193.See Directive 2009/128/EC on sustainable use of pesticides and the Nitrates Directive. SMR 13 of CAP post 2020 will link the implementation of the pesticide directive with direct payments under cross compliance, 191This threshold derives from the provisions set out under the Nitrates Directive 91/676/EC [Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources]. In practice the threshold of 170kg/ha/year has been implemented by Member States by setting limits on livestock density between 1.7 - 2.0 livestock units / ha. Livestock unit is a reference unit which facilitates the aggregation of livestock from various species and age as per convention, via the use of specific coefficients established on the basis of the nutritional or feed requirement of each type of animal (see, for example, https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Livestock_unit_(LSU))Activities do not lead to the conversion, fragmentation or unsustainable intensification of high-nature-value land, wetland, forests or other areas of high-biodiversity value194. This includes highly biodiverse grassland spanning more than one hectare that is: i) natural, namely grassland that would remain grassland in the absence of human intervention and that maintains the natural species composition and ecological characteristics and processes; or ii) non-natural, namely grassland that would cease to be grassland in the absence of human intervention and that is species-rich and not degraded and has been identified as being highly biodiverse by the relevant competent authority. Activities should not195: oConsistent with Statutory Management Directive 3 and 4 of the post 2020 CAP and specifically Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna (OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7): Article 6(1) and (2) and Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds (OJ L 20, 26.1.2010, p. 7): Article 3(1), Article 3(2)(b), Article 4(1), (2) and (4)Why manufacturing is included in the Taxonomy Manufacturing is the second largest contributor to CO2e emissions but is also be able to produce the products and technologies that can contribute to GHG emissions reductions in other sectors of the economy and is thus a fundamental part of the low-carbon economy. The manufacturing section of the Taxonomy therefore includes both the manufacturing of low-carbon technologies as well as energy intensive and hard-to-abate manufacturing sectors. It aims to give support to those economic activities that are low in carbon emissions and first movers who are engaging in a transformational shift. Manufacturing coverage and thresholds Which economic activities are included and why The economic activities covered include sectors that account for a high share of industrial GHG emissions as a result of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions related to the manufacture of the products and therefore offer large potential for GHG emissions reduction. Specifically, this includes: the manufacturing of aluminium (NACE 24.42); the manufacturing of iron and steel (NACE 24.1, 24.2, 24.3); the manufacturing of cement (NACE 23.51); and the manufacturing of chemicals (NACE 20.13, 20.14, 20.15, 20.16). Additionally, enabling activities are also included in manufacturing which covers both those activities included under “low carbon technologies” and also “mitigation measures” which when combined result in achievement of the thresholds. Low carbon activities refers to: the manufacturing of products, key components, equipment and machinery that are essential to a number of key renewable energy technologies (geothermal power, hydropower, concentrated solar power (CSP), solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, wind energy and ocean energy); the manufacturing of low-carbon transport vehicles, fleets and vessels; the manufacturing of energy efficiency equipment for buildings and other low-carbon technologies that result in substantial GHG emission reductions in further sectors of the economy (including private households).Mitigation measures are included as enabling activities since they are recognised as critical steps supporting the transition of economic activities in these high emitting manufacturing sectors towards reaching the defined thresholds.The TEG acknowledges that many manufacturing activities are still not currently covered in the Taxonomy, and this must be addressed. It should be stated, however, that the TEG have not assumed that omitted activities are non-green or brown. Due to limited time, the TEG has focused its attention on those economic activities likely to play the biggest role in leading Europe down a low-carbon pathway to meet its Paris Agreement and 2050 climate neutrality goals. Therefore, the first round of sectors included in the manufacturing section of the Taxonomy are either those energy intensive and hard-to-abate sectors that emit the most greenhouse gas emissions or those enabling manufacturing sectors that are clearly necessary for Europe’s low-carbon economic transformation. This means that other manufacturing sectors (including other energy-intensive sectors) are not currently included even if they are significant in their impact. 155For private finance users of the Taxonomy, where revenues from Taxonomy eligible activities count, such as equities (the share of a corporation would be considered eligible based on the share of revenues from Taxonomy-eligible activities): only manufacturing activities complying with the activity threshold would be considered eligible.For the uses of the Taxonomy where expenditures in Taxonomy-eligible measures count (such as for financing projects, green mortgages, the use of proceeds from green bonds or simply counting how much a corporation has invested in climate mitigation): all the investments needed to reach the activity threshold would be considered eligible. This means that measures are eligible once they are implemented entirely and the threshold is reached, as well as if individual investments in different measures are implemented over a defined time span as part of an overall investment plan (e.g. 5 or 10 years) and substantially support the activity achieving the thresholds.Application of CCS in the Manufacturing Sector In the manufacturing sector, certain processes are difficult to reduce to very low carbon levels, particularly in the metals, minerals and chemical sectors. In those cases, switching to renewable energy sources and energy efficient measures are not feasible options and very low carbon levels may only be achieved by either implementing an alternative manufacturing process, like switching to the production of alternative products, or due to the introduction of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which are addressed in another section of the Taxonomy. Additionally, if CCS enables an economic activity in the manufacturing sector to meet its screening criteria, the installation of CCS technology can be considered Taxonomy eligible once the screening criteria has been met. This also applies to overall economic activity. Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU), where the captured CO2 is utilized as a feed stock (e.g. for a chemical process), may also qualify, if substantial mitigation impacts can be demonstrated by reducing emissions towards meeting the activity criteria (e.g. the use of CO 2 for enhanced oil extraction would not qualify). Coherence with other sections of the Taxonomy Due to the nature of manufacturing, and in order to undertake a proper systemic value chain approach in the Taxonomy, close linkages have been made with the energy, transport, agriculture and building sectors. Where possible, circularity considerations (in so far as they affect GHG emissions) and a broader value chain approach have been considered. Given the role of the manufacturing sector in supply chains, the future Platform will need to review the thresholds to assess whether changes will be necessary to accommodate the planned circular economy objectives of the Taxonomy. i.e.it is recommended that at the point in time when the Platform work to define threshold criteria for meeting substantial circular economy contributions the manufacturing thresholds currently defined with regard to mitigation and adaptation objectives are reviewed.Next steps and recommendations 1. The TEG recognizes that the scope of the manufacturing section of the Taxonomy should be extended to cover more manufacturing activities. Care must continue to be taken to review the context in which the Taxonomy is applied to ensure that it does not identify activities as green which have perverse incentives or a negative impact on other environmental objectives. From a manufacturing perspective, the TEGFurther analysis of high polluting activities such as glass manufacturing, paper and pulp manufacturing, and textiles. The manufacturing processes for these activities are complex, multiple and result in the production of an array of diverse products. The TEG recommends that the future platform address these manufacturing sectors, by prioritising those processes that contribute the most significant portion of emissions (e.g. steam generation in the paper and pulp sector) and work to establish thresholds for these specific processes.Mining: this is an important sector both in terms of avoiding bottlenecks in the deployment of lowcarbon technologies by providing the critical materials needed for low-carbon technologies, as well as the value chain link with energy-intensive manufacturing sectors. Unfortunately, the TEG was not able to complete work for this sector due to time constraints and the complexity of the issues The TEG recommends that the platform analyse the role the sector plays in terms of enhancing availability of the critical materials needed for current and future technologies to create a climate neutral, circular and resource efficient economy, while sourcing raw materials in a sustainable and responsible way, with a view to consider the enabling potential of the sector. The platform is recommended to ensure that a life cycle approach is applied when assessing the different phases of the value chain for mining is applied. The rational for applying life cycle analysis is that many metals are essential for low-carbon technologies. For example, Aluminium for lightweight cars; Copper for electrics and motors in electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines; Battery metals (Cobalt, Lead, Lithium, Manganese, and Nickel) for clean mobility and grid storage batteries; Zinc and Cobalt for protecting off-shore wind turbines; Silicon in solar panels; Precious metals for clean mobility and solar panels.Further analysis for light manufacturing sectors may also need to be considered by the platform as these sectors grow in impact. For these, the platform could either try to develop individual activity criteria for each (where feasible) or identify key improvement measures applicable across a number of these sectors and classify them as individual enabling activities.Red Mud: A waste by product of the process for producing al oxide from the bauxite ore for aluminium, referred to as red mud contains toxic heavy metals and its high alkalinity makes it corrosive and damaging to soil and life forms, presenting potentially substantial impacts when disposed. Toxic dumps and settling pools are a feature alongside all bauxite/alumina plants worldwide, including across Europe, Russia, China, Guinea, Brazil, Jamaica and Australia. The global average of bauxite residue generated per tonne of alumina is between 1 and 1.5 tonnes; it is estimated that over 150 million tonnes of bauxite residue are produced annually – 5-6 million tonnes in Europe alone, and the majority of this waste is being landfilled. The platform is recommended to consider the impacts of red mud under minimum social and health safeguards and develop an approach to set up criteria to integrate this within the DNSH environmental impact.The platform is recommended to carry out a risk-based assessment on the exposure scenarios for all chemicals/products/by-products contained in the taxonomy. It is to be noted that other organic and inorganic chemicals/products/by-products included in the taxonomy are also potentially hazardous to human health and the environment depending upon the exposure scenarios, and therefore objective, scientifically robust, risk-based assessments should be carried out for all. 159Review the thresholds in the light of circular economy objectives and takes into consideration the impact of applying an additional requirement that for those economic activities where BATAssociated Energy Efficiency Levels (BAT-AEELs) exist, these must also be met. The implications of this in terms of global application of the Taxonomy will need to be considered.Further analysis on the inclusion of factories or companies that produce the following technologies. For example, heat pumps, LED lighting, Hot water fittings (e.g. taps, showers) that are rated in the top class (dark green) of the European Water Label Scheme (http://www.europeanwaterlabel.eu/ ) may be produced by a factory or company but other things may also be produced.The platform is recommended to consider developing specific thresholds for different applications of cement, e.g. concrete for specific building applications. The focus should be on the substitution of clinker by binders with a lower content of embedded CO2. Cement is currently produced in many different qualities, which are sometimes used in different applications. As a result exchange between two qualities is not always possible. Therefore, on the way to a climate-neutral economy, it has to be determined which types of cement in which application areas can be replaced by those with a reduced clinker content, taking into account the availability of clinker substitutes. Within the decarbonisation of other industries, it may be possible that material flows used today (e.g. fly ash) will no longer be available in the future as a clinker substitute, while the suitability of other materials has not yet been proven. The cement types, which are absolutely necessary in a climate-neutral economy and cannot be replaced, must be produced in a climate-friendly way. For these types, it then should be examined to what extent the clinker ratio can be lowered, how energy efficiency can be increased, how electricity from renewable energies can be used, etc.The mitigation thresholds proposed in the taxonomy for manufacturing specifically address the segment in the supply chain with the highest direct emissions (i.e. the scope 1 and 2 emissions related to the manufacturing of the product). Given the role of the manufacturing sector in supply chains, circular economy objectives are of particular relevance for this sector. Once threshold criteria for meeting substantial circular economy contributions are being developed, we recommend reviewing these in the context of the mitigation threshold criteria, which address a specific segment of the circular economy. For example, improving LCA within the manufacturing sector. For example, LCA consideration of products (steel/aluminium/cement).With regard to both data availability and value chain depth, it is recommended that further care be taken by the platform to address two issues: first, the possibility of looking at data complementary to the ETS benchmarks; and secondly to ensure that a more complete value chain analysis is undertaken, which will include resource efficiency, in order to match current legislative discussions around circularity and critical materials-use, including responsible sourcingThe manufacture of low carbon technologies that result in substantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy (including private households) is eligible provided that product related emissions are at least the level of best available techniques i.e. a factory that produces electric cars, but burns coal is not eligible).1. Manufacture of products, key components and machinery that are essential for eligible renewable energy technologies (Geothermal Power, Hydropower, Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), Solar Photovoltaic (PV), solar thermal energy for district heat production, Wind energy, Ocean energy, bio energy technologies that meet the conversion efficiency requirements set in the Renewable Energy Directive (2018/2001/EU) and Green hydrogen and hydrogen electrolysis installation1972. Manufacture of low carbon transport vehicles and their respective key components , fleets and vessels meeting the following criteria is eligible: Passenger cars, light commercial vehicles (CO2 Regulation for cars and vans (EU) 2019/631): 197 Hydrogen electrolysis installation will be part of the taxonomy if it shows a considerable level of green electricity consumption and shows a pathway towards an increased share of green electricity over the years to comeZero direct emission heavy-duty vehicles that emits less than 1g CO2/kWh (or 1g CO2/km for certain N2 vehicles); low-emission heavy-duty vehicles with specific direct CO2emissions of less than 50% of the reference CO2emissions of all vehicles in the same sub-group.High efficiency lighting appliances rated in the highest energy efficiency class that is significantly populated in the energy efficiency label (or higher classes) according to EU energy labelling regulationsHighly efficient space heating and domestic hot water systems rated in the highest energy efficiency class significantly populated in the energy efficiency label (or higher classes) according to EU energy labelling regulations Highly efficient cooling and ventilation systems rated in the highest energy efficiency class significantly populated in the energy efficiency label or higher classes according to EU energy labelling regulations Heat pumps compliant with the criteria for heat pumps given in the energy section of the taxonomy4. The manufacture of low carbon technologies and their key components that result in substantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy (including private households) is eligible if they demonstrate substantial higher net GHG emission reductions compared to the best performing alternative technology/ product/ solution available on the market on the basis of a recognised/standardised cradle-to-cradle carbon footprint assessment (e.g. ISO 14067, 14040, EPD or PEF) validated by a third party.Rationale The list of specific eligible technologies is coherent with the eligible activities in other sections of the Taxonomy, namely energy, transport and buildings. However, in some cases, the list is less broad than the eligible activities in the corresponding section of the Taxonomy due to limited resources to explore in this phase the implications for use in other sectors of the same products, components, equipment and infrastructure. Further analysis is required to ensure no perverse incentives occur. For transport the manufacture is focused on the production of complete low carbon or zero carbon vehicles, fleets or vessels so that either revenue from sales of eligible vehicles or expenditure on investments in manufacturing capacity specifically relating to eligible vehicles can be identified. Do no significant harm assessment The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the manufacture of low carbon technologies is associated with: 164Depending on the product/equipment being manufactured, there may, also be issues with respect to the embodied carbon and the demand for certain metals and materials (e.g. rare earth metals) which are in limited supply and may have significant environmental impact issues associated with the mining phase. (2) AdaptationIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented.Embodied carbon emissions should represent less than 50% of the total carbon emissions saved by the use of the energy efficient equipment. Carbon emissions and savings at the end-of-life stage are not included in the assessment for this criteria (too uncertain).Compliance with the REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) Regulation (1272/2008/EC) and the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Regulation (2002/95/EC) or the equivalent for equipment manufactured and used outside the EU (n.b.: equipment manufactured outside of the EU but imported into the EU must comply with the REACH and RoHS Regulations).Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with the EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment (2014/52/EU) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (2001/42/EC) (or other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks) – whichever is stricter - in the case of sites/operations in non-EU countries) for the site/operation (including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations, waste disposal facilities, etc.) and any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems, in particular UNESCO World Heritage and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), have been implemented. For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (COM (2011) 244), the Birds (2009/147/EC) and Habitats (92/43/EEC) Directives (or other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – whichever is stricter - in case of sites/operations in non-EU countries) based on the conservation objectives of the protected area. For such sites/operations, ensure that: 165a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources; all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats; andThe manufacturing of cement is associated with significant CO2 emissions. Minimising process emissions through energy efficiency improvements and switch to alternative fuels, promoting the reduction of the clinker to cement ration and the use of alternative clinkers and binders can contribute to the mitigation objective. Mitigation measures are eligible provided they are incorporated into a single investment plan within a determined time frame (5 or 10 years) that outlines how each of the measures in combination with others will in combination enable the activity to meet the threshold defined below actions.Thresholds for cement Clinker (A) are applicable to plants that produce clinker only, and do not produce finished cement. All other plants need to meet the thresholds for cement or alternative binder (A) Cement clinker: Specific emissions (calculated according to the methodology used for EUETS benchmarks) associated to the clinker production processes are lower than the value of the related EU-ETS benchmark. As of February 2020, the EU-ETS benchmark value for cement clinker manufacturing is: 0.766 tCO2e/t of clinker198 (B) Cement: Specific emissions associated to the clinker and cement production processes are lower than: 0.498 tCO2e/t of cement or alternative binder 199Rationale Cement production is responsible for more than 70% of the emissions under C.23 and concrete is the most significant application for the use of cement. Cement is the main constituent of concrete. The content of cement in the concrete and total GHG emissions can vary significantly based on the198 Based on the EU ETS benchmark for grey cement clinker (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D0278&from=EN ). The threshold for cement clinker needs to be revised every time that there is an update in the EU ETS benchmark value for grey cement clinker. 199 Threshold was derived taking into account the threshold for cement clinker and the threshold for clinker to cement ratio. It excludes emissions from electricity use that is mainly required for finish grinding, raw materials grinding and the exhaust fans (kiln/raw mill and cement mill).Electricity: Indirect emissions from the use of electricity during the clinker and cement production The main users of electricity in cement plants are the mills (grinding of cement, milling of raw materials) and the exhaust fans (kiln/raw mill and cement mill, which together account for more than 80% of the electrical energy usage. The electricity demand in cement plants ranges from 90 to 150 kWh/t cement 202.200 https://webstore.iea.org/technology-roadmap-low-carbon-transition-in-the-cement-industry 201 As weighted average for the total production of the facility. Global average in 2014 was 0.65. EU around 0.75, and projected to 0.65 in 2030 202 https://webstore.iea.org/technology-roadmap-low-carbon-transition-in-the-cement-industryImproving energy efficiency: Thermal energy intensity of clinker and the electric intensity of cement can be reduced by deploying existing state-of-the-art technologies in new cement plants and retrofitting existing facilities to improve energy performance levels when economically viable. Switching to alternative fuels: The carbon intensity of cement clinker can be reduced significantly by the use of biomass and waste materials as fuels in cement kilns. The clinkerburning process offers good conditions for using different types of waste materials replacing parts of the consumption of carbon-intensive fossil fuels. A wide range of different types of wastes can be used as fuels but as these can replace primary fuel in cement kilns, a consistent waste quality is essential (e.g. adequate calorific value, metal, halogen and ash content). Reducing the clinker to cement ratio: Increasing the use of blended materials and the market deployment of blended cements is very important for the decarbonisation of the sector and alignment with a low carbon pathway. This requires substitution of cement clinker by mineral additives such as fly ash, silica fume or blast-furnace slag. The amount of clinker substitute that can be blended in the cement depends on the type of substitute and the type of cement produced. Some mineral additives, e.g. GBFS, allow for substitution levels of over 70 per cent. Revision of the cement and concrete standards, building codes and public procurement regulations would be required in order to allow more widespread use of blended cements with very high substitution of clinker (e.g. >60%) while ensuring product reliability and durability at final application. Alternative clinkers and binders: Alternative clinker formulations (e.g. belite, CSA, BCSA, CACS, MOMS) and alternative binders (e.g. alkali-activated binders) could offer potential opportunities for CO2 emissions reductions by using different mixes of raw materials or alternatives compared to Portland cement. Their commercial availability and applicability differ widely. Further efforts are required to support the demonstration, testing and earlier stage research for alternative clinkers and binders and to develop standards to facilitate market deployment. The specification of the benchmark based on ton of binder will allow investments in these types of novel alternative binders to be considered for eligibility under the EU Sustainable Taxonomy. Renewable energy generation and use: Electricity supplied from renewable energy sources could be explored as a measure to reduce carbon intensity of the final cement product. This canbe achieved through different strategies including implementing renewable-based captive power generation, power purchase agreements that ensure electricity imports are provided from renewable sources or demand-side response strategies that enable a flexible electricity demand (e.g. a flexible operating strategy of grinding plants throughout the day). Various renewablebased options are available for cement manufacturers including wind power, solar photovoltaic power, solar thermal power and small hydropower generation. Potential deployment of these technologies in cement plants is highly dependent on local conditions. Transportation emissions: The emissions from transportation are excluded as these represent only a small percentage of the total emissions of cement manufacture.Additional information: European Commission, Report. Competitiveness of the European Cement and Lime Sectors, December 2017 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/competitiveness-european-cement-and-lime-sectors_en Provisions to determine the benchmarks in the period from 2021 to 2025 and for the period from 2026 to 2030 are included in Art. 10a, paragraphs 2(a) and 2(c) of the Directive 2003/87/EC. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02003L008720180408&qid=1547917622180&from=EN Do no significant harm assessment The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from cement manufacturing is associated with:   Polluting emissions to air associated to the consumption of fossil fuels and calcinations reaction in the cement kiln; Water consumption at production facilities located in water-stressed areas; Potential for soil and groundwater contamination associated with the handling and storage of (hazardous) wastes used as fuel substitute (‘secondary’ fuels) in the cement production process;Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented.For cement production sites using hazardous wastes as alternative fuels, ensure a waste management plan that meets EU standards (or equivalent for plants operated in non-EU countries) exists and is implemented.Ensure emissions to air and water are within the BAT-AEL ranges set in the BREF for the Production of Cement, Lime and Magnesium Oxide1 A stringent level of BAT-AEL is required if an activity materially contributes to local air pollution levels, exceeding air quality standards Ensure implementation of a recognised environmental management system (ISO 14001, EMAS, or equivalent). Exclusion of refuse derived fuels for cement production. Co-incineration of waste has significant impacts on health and the environment due to the polluting nature of the associated emissions, and higher emissions ceiling for cement plants in comparison with dedicated waste incineration plants. Furthermore, promoting waste as eligible fuel source may undermine waste minimisation efforts in other sectors.Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with the EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment (2014/52/EU) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (2001/42/EC) (or other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks) – whichever is stricter - in the case of sites/operations in non-EU countries) for the site/operation (including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations, waste disposal facilities, etc.) and any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems, particularly UNESCO World Heritage and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), have been implemented.For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (COM (2011) 244), the Birds (2009/147/EC) and Habitats (92/43/EEC) Directives (or other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – whichever is stricter - in case of sites/operations in non-EU countries) based on the conservation objectives of the protected area. For such sites/operations, ensure that: all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats; and a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented.The manufacturing of aluminium is a highly energy intensive process. The CO2 emissions related to the production of aluminium are primarily scope 2 emissions (i.e. from the generation of the electricity used). Aluminium manufacturing is eligible if relying on low carbon electricity and reduced direct emissions. Furthermore, all aluminium recycling is eligible due to significantly lower emissions than primary production. Mitigation measures are eligible provided they are incorporated into a single investment plan within a determined time frame (5 or 10 years) that outlines how each of the measures in combination with others will in combination enable the activity to meet the threshold defined below actionsManufacture of primary aluminium is eligible if Criteria 1 (see below) is met in combination with either criteria 2 or 3 (see below): 1. Criteria 1: Direct emission for primary aluminium production is at or below the value of the related EU-ETS benchmark. As of February 2020, the EU-ETS benchmarks values for aluminium manufacturing is 1.514 tCO2e/t. Direct emissions are to be calculated according to the methodology used for EU-ETS benchmarks) 2. Criteria 2: Electricity consumption for electrolysis is at or below: 15.29 MWh/t (European average emission factor according to International Aluminium Institute, 2017, to be updated annually)204 3. Criteria 3: Average carbon intensity of the electricity that is used for primary aluminium production (electrolysis) is at or below: 100 g CO2e/kWh (Taxonomy threshold for electricity production, subject to periodical update).Emissions related to the manufacturing of aluminium are primarily related to the use of electricity. Electricity costs contribute to over 50% of the production costs. Consequently, there is a strong incentive for the aluminium industry to aim for improving energy efficiency. The key action for aluminium production to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation is to increase its share of use of low carbon electricity. It is acknowledged that on the short term the availability low carbon electricity may be a limiting factor, depending on the region. This will change in on the medium term, when sufficient low carbon electricity will become available. The second action for aluminium production to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation is to decrease the process’s direct emissions and the emissions due to fuel use for on-site energy production It is acknowledged that aluminium production facilities can play an important role in stabilizing electricity grids by active management of electricity demand. This may result in substantial mitigation contributions, e.g. by limiting the need for electricity storage facilities. However, given the lack of available metrics to quantify these impacts, these benefits are not taken into account at this stage. It is acknowledged that aluminium will play a role in a low carbon economy, in particular enabling light weight products and electrification (including transmission wires). Such applications could also be considered eligible under the activity "Manufacture of other low carbon technologies" provided they can demonstrate substantial emissions reductions according to the criteria for that activity. Furthermore, compared to a number of other construction materials, e.g. steel or plastics, the current process for aluminium manufacturing is easy to decarbonise, i.e. by use of low carbon electricity, All aluminium recycling is considered to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation because of its association with much lower emissions than primary productionScope 1: all direct emissions related to the production (the process’s direct emissions and the emissions due to fuel use for on-site energy production). Scope 2: Electricity consumption for electrolysis process and related emissions from the generation of the electricity used.ASI Performance standard, version 2, December 2017, https://aluminium-stewardship.org/asistandards/asi-performance-standard/ CO2 benchmark as defined for free allocation of Emission allowances under the ETS: 1.514 allowances/ton Al International Aluminium institute: http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/primary-aluminiumsmelting-energy-intensity/the potential for significant air emission impacts: perfluorocarbons, fluoride gases, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and particulate matter (e.g. unused cryolite). Hydrogen fluorides can be toxic to vegetation; the toxic, corrosive and reactive nature of waste generated by the used linings (cathodes) from the electrolytic cells (known as spent pot lining (SPL)). Dissolved fluorides and cyanides from the SPL material can create significant environmental impacts including groundwater contamination and pollution of local watercourses; the ability (or lacking thereof) of aluminium manufacturing plants to incorporate aluminium scrap (including scrap from their own manufacturing processes) in the production process; and the potential to impact ecosystems as a result of the land footprint of the site and from polluting emissions.Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented.In order to avoid risks to circular economy, aluminium manufacturing plants need to be able to process aluminium scrap. In order to avoid unnecessary resource and energy consumption, the aluminium scrap collection and sorting activities should be optimised for separation on an alloy specific basis. If scrap alloys are mixed, the functionality of the recycled material is restricted, and valuable alloying elements may be lost. (5) PollutionEmissions to air (e.g. sulphur dioxide - SO2, nitrogen oxide - NOx, particulate matter, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), dioxins, , mercury (Hg), hydrogen chloride (HCL), hydrogen fluoride (HF), Total Fluoride, and (PFCs) polyfluorinated hydrocarbons (PFCs)) are within the BAT-AEL ranges set in the BREF for the Non-Ferrous Metals Industries. 205 A stringent level of BAT-AEL is required if an activity materially contributes to local air pollution levels, exceeding air quality standardsEnsure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with the EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment (2014/52/EU) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (2001/42/EC) (or other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks) – whichever is stricter - in the case of sites/operations in non-EU countries) for the site/operation (including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations, waste disposal facilities, etc.) and any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems, in particular UNESCO Word Heritage and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), have been implemented.For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (COM (2011) 244), the Birds (2009/147/EC) and Habitats (92/43/EEC) Directives (or other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – whichever is stricter - in case of sites/operations in non-EU countries) based on the conservation objectives of the protected area. For such sites/operations, ensure that: a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources (2018); all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats; andC24.1: Manufacture of basic iron and steel and of ferro-alloys C24.2: Manufacture of tubes, pipes, hollow profiles and related fittings, of steel C24.3: Manufacture of other products of first processing of steel C24.5.1: Casting of iron C24.5.2: Casting of steelManufacturing of iron and steel at the level of performance achieved by best performing plants is considered to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. Furthermore, secondary production of steel (i.e. using scrap steel) is considered eligible due to significantly lower emissions than primary steel production. Mitigation measures are eligible provided they are incorporated into a single investment plan within a determined time frame (5 or 10 years) that outlines how each of the measures in combination with others will in combination enable the activity to meet the threshold defined below actionsManufacturing of iron and steel is eligible if the GHG emissions (calculated according to the methodology used for EU-ETS benchmarks) associated to the production processes are lower than the values of the related EU-ETS benchmarks. As of February 2020, the EU-ETS benchmarks values for iron and steel manufacturing are: blast furnace top gas recycling with carbon capture and storage; direct smelting reduction processes direct reduction with natural gas for production of DRI combined with EAF steelmaking; hydrogen steelmaking in shaft furnaces using H2 produced via water electrolysis (e.g. using renewable electricity sources); direct electrolysis of iron ore;This activity focuses on the greening of iron and steel manufacturing due to its high contribution to global GHG emissions. The potential of greening by products made of iron and steel can be addressed through other activities such as “manufacture of other low carbon technologies” where according to the criteria given for this activity, the manufacturer can prove the overall environmental benefits over the whole life. Do no significant harm assessment The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from iron and steel production is associated with: emissions to air from coke-making and smelting operations, especially particulate matter (dust), oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, chlorides, fluorides, volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/furans, and heavy metals; emissions to water of hydrocarbons and suspended solids; water consumption for quenching and cooling operations in water stressed areas; the potential to impact local ecosystems and biodiversity due to the polluting emissions (if not properly mitigated) and due to the large land footprint of the operations and associated ancillary activities; and wastes and by products from the coking and smelting operations including, tar and benzole. 177Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented.Ensure emissions to water and air are within the BAT-AEL ranges set in the BREF for iron and steel production (e.g. for pH, total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), chromium (total) and heavy metals, for sulphur dioxide - SO2, nitrogen oxide - NOx, particulate matter, polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins/furans, mercury (Hg), hydrogen chloride (HCL) and hydrogen fluoride (HF).

Hydrogen generated as a process by product of the chlor-alkali production is not eligible. Mitigation measures are eligible provided they are incorporated into a single investment plan within a determined time frame (5 or 10 years) that outlines how each of the measures in combination with others will in combination enable the activity to meet the threshold defined below actionsAverage carbon intensity of the electricity produced that is used for hydrogen manufacturing is at or below 100 gCO2e/kWh (Taxonomy threshold for electricity production, subject to periodical update).Rationale Currently, almost 96% of industrially-produced hydrogen is manufactured via steam reforming using fossil fuels: 48% (natural gas), 30% (liquid hydrocarbon) and 18% (coal). Steam reforming is a mature process, associated with high CO2 emissions and incompatible with the EU Strategy for long-term EU greenhouse gas emissions reductions.206 Energy efficiency and JRC emissions, Perspective scenarios for the chemical and petrochemical industry, JRC (2017), page 12. http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC105767/kj-na-28471-enn.pdf. Accounting for approximately 9% of the emissions from the chemical sector.

A minimum requirement is the implementation and adherence to a recognised environmental management system (ISO 14001, EMAS, or equivalent).Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with the EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment (2014/52/EU) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (2001/42/EC) (or other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks) – whichever is stricter - in the case of sites/operations in non-EU countries) for the site/operation (including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations, waste disposal facilities, etc.) and any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems, particularly UNESCO World Heritage and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) have been implemented. For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (COM (2011) 244), the Birds (2009/147/EC) and Habitats (92/43/EEC) Directives (or other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – whichever is stricter - in case of sites/operations in non-EU countries) based on the conservation objectives of the protected area. For such sites/operations, ensure that: a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources; all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats; and a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented.Reducing the emissions from the manufacturing of carbon black and soda ash and improving energy efficiency and switching to low carbon electricity 210 in the manufacturing of chlorine can positively contribute to the climate change mitigation objective. Mitigation measures are eligible provided they are incorporated into a single investment plan within a determined time frame (5 or 10 years) that outlines how each of the measures in combination with others will in combination enable the activity to meet the threshold defined below actionsManufacturing of carbon black and soda ash are eligible if the GHG emissions (calculated according to the methodology used for EU-ETS benchmarks) associated to the production processes are lower than the values of the related EU-ETS benchmarks. As of February 2020, the EU-ETS benchmarks values are:  210 See page 40 https://dechema.de/dechema_media/Downloads/Positionspapiere/Technology_study_Low_carbon_energy_and_feedstock_for_the_ European_chemical_industry-p-20002750.pdf 211 https://www.eurochlor.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/12-electrolysis_production_costs.pdfRationale The manufacturing process of carbon black accounts for approximately 3.4% of the GHG emissions from the chemical sector, while the manufacturing of soda ash accounts for 1.5% of the emissions. 212 The manufacturing process of chlorine is extremely energy-intensive, with chlor-alkali process accounting for 17% of total electrical consumption of the European chemical and petrochemical industry.213 Reducing the manufacturing emissions for carbon black and soda ash and improving energy efficiency in the manufacturing of chlorine can positively contribute to the mitigation objective. Moreover it is recognised that soda ash used in double glazing can enhance building efficiency gains. The absolute performance approach has been proposed in order to identify the maximum acceptable carbon intensities of the manufacturing processes of carbon black and soda ash that the activities should comply with in order to be able to substantially contribute to the mitigation objective. For the manufacturing of chlorine, a process that uses electricity to fuel the electrolysis process, the absolute performance approach has been proposed in order to identify the energy intensity threshold. In addition to complying with the energy efficiency threshold, the process shall be based on low carbon electricity. ETS product benchmarks have been selected as thresholds for the manufacturing of carbon black and soda ash. They reflect the average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in a sector. Emissions covered: − Scope 1: All direct emissions related to the production (the process direct emissions and the emissions due to fuel use for energy production). − Note on the electricity: According to the methodology to calculate ETS benchmarks, emissions from electricity are considered where direct emissions and indirect emissions from electricity are to a certain level interchangeable (as is the case for carbon black but not for soda ash).214 For chlorine, the value corresponding to an efficient level of electricity consumption was selected as the threshold given that the main source of energy used for the production of chlorine is electricity and by improving the energy efficiency of the process, as well as using low carbon electricity sources, the activity can substantially contribute to the climate change mitigation objective. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2012:387:0005:0013:EN:PDF https://epub.wupperinst.org/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6478/file/6478_Lechtenboehmer.pdf212 Page 14 http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC105767/kj-na-28471-enn.pdf 213 page 11 http://eippcb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reference/BREF/CAK_BREF_102014.pdf 214 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D0278&from=EN https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/ets/allowances/docs/gd9_sector_specific_guidance_en.pdfIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

There are many types of plastics which are used in the production of multiple end products. The Taxonomy seeks to avoid including manufacture of products that do not have a positive impact in mitigation. Disposable plastic products are highly energy inefficient and undermine efforts to contribute to mitigation. In this context, plastic manufacturing is only eligible when at least 90% of the final plastic is not used for single use consumer products and is not recycled. This needs to be confirmed needs to be confirmed from science based research/studies etc. Mitigation measures are eligible provided they are incorporated into a single investment plan within a determined time frame (5 or 10 years) that outlines how each of the measures in combination with others will in combination enable the activity to meet the threshold defined below actionsManufacture of plastics in primary form shall comply with at least one of the following three criteria and when relevant with the additional criteria, reported below: 1) The plastics in primary form is manufactured by mechanical recycling 2) The plastics in primary form is manufactured by chemical recycling including: chemical depolymerisation (aka monomerisation), pyrolysis, gasification, solvent-based purification of polymers etc When applying criterion 2, the carbon footprint of the plastics in primary form, manufactured by chemical recycling (excluding any calculated benefit from the production of fuels), shall be lower when compared to the carbon footprint of the plastics in primary form manufactured with fossil fuel feedstock.

Where municipal bio-waste is used as a feedstock, the project shall be complementary to and not compete with existing municipal bio-waste management infrastructure; Rationale Plastics production has been sharply growing over the last years and emissions from the plastics sector are expected to increase, not only because consumption is expected to increase – and so also the emissions from the manufacturing process - but also because plastics release CO2 when incinerated. In order to reduce CO2 emissions from the plastics sector it is therefore important to promote reduction in use of disposable consumer plastics, and promote increase in materials recirculation and manufacture of polymers with renewable feedstock. The manufacturing sector has a role to play in improving the contribution of the plastics supply chain to climate mitigation. It can contribute significantly to reducing the quantities of available disposable consumer plastics in the market but has limited control on the use of plastics. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note on the link between manufacturing activity under NACE code 20.16 and code 22.2. The manufacturing of plastics in primary form is covered by NACE code 20.16 and the definition of “primary form” includes: liquids and pastes, blocks or irregular shape, lumps, powders (including molding powders), granules, flakes and similar bulk forms. 232 The manufacturing of plastic products falls under the NACE code 22.2.

It follows that the criteria for activity 22.2 should aim to promote:the manufacture of plastic products which are substantially based on recycled plastics in line with the EU strategy for plastics,234 to minimize the production of virgin plastics, and the manufacture of plastic products which are based on plastics in primary form, which are wholly or partially derived from renewable feedstock.polluting emissions to air and water from the production process; vulnerable ecosystems might be damaged by the construction and/or operation of the production facilities; the use of water resources for production purposes (e.g. cooling water) in water stressed areas); and the generation of hazardous wastes.The production of polymers includes a lot of synthesis, hence, in order to allow a clear demarcation and in order to NOT go beyond the limits of this sector 20.16 it has to be acknowledged that precursors are covered under C.20.11, C.20.13, C.20.14; C.20.15.

The Taxonomy work on the heat and power sector has attempted to recognise this finding by developing suitably ambitious requirements within a model of supporting a transition to the EU’s emission reduction goals. Criteria: Metrics and Thresholds This section covers a wide range of activities pertaining to the production, storage and delivery of heat and electrical energy. Technology-agnostic criteria have been developed for different sources of electricity and heating and cooling. This section also recognizes the important role that improvements to the supporting infrastructure associated with delivering both types of energy will play in meeting the EU’s net-zero emissions objective. The TEG has developed these Taxonomy criteria for the energy sector so they can be used globally. An overarching, technology-agnostic emissions intensity threshold of 100g CO2e / kWh is proposed for electricity generation, heat production and the co-generation of heat and electricity. This threshold will be reduced every five years in line with political targets set out to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. For electricity and heat generation activities, an ISO 14067 or a GHG Protocol Product Lifecycle Standard compliant Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) assessment including measurement of fugitive emissions is required,. This includes actual physical measurements of methane leakage from the point of extraction/well-head to production of energy (electricity and/or heat). The TEG acknowledges that improved standards and methodologies will develop and recommend that the acceptance of the ISO 14067, GHG Protocol Product LIfecycle Standard and the PCF methodologies is reviewed periodically reviewed by the platform. To aid the transition to a net-zero economy, certain technologies, such as solar, wind and tidal energy are derogated from the requirement to conduct PCFs assessments on the basis that these technologies currently perform significantly below the emissions intensity threshold. These derogations are subject to regular review in accordance with the declining threshold. Furthermore, In the case where CCS is used to meet the emissions intensity threshold, a contractual agreement is required as proof to show that the carbon will be transported and sequestered in economic activities which are themselves eligible under the taxonomy.237 Greenhouse gas emissions by economic activity according to the NACE classification EU-28, 2016. Eurostat (env_ac_ainah_r2) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Climate_change__driving_forces#Total_emissions.2C_main_breakdowns_by_source_and_general_drivers.Future emissions are in line with EU political commitments for the ETS sector (-43% by 2030), then linearly decline to zero by 2050. Future electricity demand (net generation) is assumed to grow as per the EU 2016 PRIMES Reference Scenario.To determine a single technology-neutral threshold covering all technologies, the methodology considers the average annual emissions factors over a period of 40 years 238 from the time of commissioning.The above calculation results in a threshold that varies by year of commissioning. To avoid updating it annually, and to provide some stability and certainty for investors, the threshold value is fixed for a238 Power plants can have typical lifetimes of between 15 and over 100 years, depending on technology, operating mode and maintenance profile. 40 years is the maximum period over which the large majority of power plants can reasonably be expected to operate and emit GHGs without some form of repowering.Although the 100 gCo2e/kWh threshold is derived from power sector assumptions, it will apply equally to both electricity and heating/cooling generation. During future reviews of the threshold, actual energy sector emissions and generation, as well as long term projections and policy targets will be updated as necessary.Blended gas-fired power: Co-combustion of multiple gases for the production of electricity, heat/cool and co-generation is also subject to the emissions intensity threshold. This includes combustion of RED II gases.Hydropower: the embedded emissions associated with the construction of hydropower facilities and the alteration of landscapes constitute a significant portion of lifecycle analysis emissions. Such emissions can be compensated for, by a complementary emissions reduction activity as mentioned above.Brief summary of the stakeholder feedback on electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning The energy working group thanks all respondents to energy criteria for their time and effort invested to provide input and help improve the energy taxonomy criteria. The following brief summary tries to highlight key feedback. The energy working group has evaluated the feedback and used the feedback in developing this report. Stakeholders highlighted that there are different levels of detail and ambition across the different activities. Stakeholders noted this might not fully be technology neutral. This includes some technologies being exempted from LCE analysis requirements. Other respondents suggested increasing the exemption list from LCE assessments.The EU Taxonomy should be aligned with current legislation (particularly the Renewable Energy Directive) for DNSH and bioenergy, as outlined by some respondents. Where there are standards and requirements, it was suggested making reference to them within the EU Taxonomy. Some respondents also noted that the EU Taxonomy should be structured in a way that minimises additional burden.In addition to the feedback received on the activities covered within the Technical Report for the EU Taxonomy from June 2019, several stakeholders would have liked to see the inclusion or a stronger acknowledgement of nuclear energy, waste-to-energy and unabated natural gas.Adjustments to thresholds: energy thresholds should be revisited on a five-year basis, in order to reflect state of the art research and progress on decarbonisation efforts. Particularly, the emission threshold for electricity generation should be reduced every five years.Adjustment of DNSH criteria: the criteria should be revisited and adjusted in accordance with the development of further taxonomy criteria on other environmental objectives and advances in research. 208Inclusion of new technologies: technological progress could allow for market entry in the near future. Technologies with a sufficiently high technology readiness level (TRL) could be added to the Taxonomy (e.g. nuclear fusion).Development of further metrics: as energy markets decarbonise and deployment patterns of certain technologies change, some activities (e.g. storage of electricity) might require the development of further metrics.The TEG also recognises that the use of biomass for energy requires trade-off decisions relative to other potential uses and across mitigation activities, but also for do no significant harm dimensions. For these reasons, the TEG recognises that possible production and use of bioenergy will require further consideration as the Taxonomy is developed and based on technical feedback in the outreach period.Market impact The TEG adopted a technology-neutral approach that can ensure rapid decarbonisation within the electricity sector. Adherence to the declining emissions intensity threshold is technically feasible for virtually any energy generation technology. However, it does imply that unabated fossil fuel combustion, namely coal and natural gas, will be ineligible under the Taxonomy. TEG deliberations on waste-to-energy On waste incineration with energy recovery (waste-to-energy, WtE) experts’ opinions differed on whether this would be an appropriate environmentally sustainable activity offering a substantial contribution to climate mitigation. On the one hand, there were arguments against the inclusion of WtE. These highlighted the large portion of waste currently incinerated that could be recycled, the reliance of some individual Member States on the incineration of municipal waste, and the risk that further increasing capacities risk overcapacity and could result in lock-in effects. This would in turn discourage more reuse and recycling, options higher in the waste hierarchy that could deliver higher climate mitigation benefits. On the other hand, it was emphasized that WtE has a role to play even in an increasingly circular economy, as not all residual waste can be reused or recycled (as acknowledged by the EC in its Communication COM(2017)34 on ‘the role of waste-to-energy in the circular economy’, Section 5). According to the political agreement on the Taxonomy Regulation, any activity leading to a significant increase in the incineration (including WtE) of waste is not considered an eligible activity, as it causes harm to the environmental objective of the circular economy, as per Article 12(d) of the EU Taxonomy regulation, with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste. This exception was not part of the Commission’s proposal, which considered any significant increase of incineration capacity harmful to the circular economy and hence ineligible. Therefore, the TEG has not included WtE, but recommends bringing this matter for further discussion and consideration to the Platform on Sustainable Finance, in light of the changes in the political agreement text. TEG deliberations on nuclear energy The TEG assessed nuclear energy as part of its review on energy generation activities. Nuclear energy generation has near to zero greenhouse gas emissions in the energy generation phase and can be a contributor to climate mitigation objectives. Consideration of nuclear energy by the TEG from a climate mitigation perspective was therefore warranted. The proposed Taxonomy regulation and thus TEG’s methodology for including activities in the Taxonomy explicitly includes two equally important aspects, Substantial Contribution to one environmental objective 209240 IPCC, 2014: Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change.

Finally, criteria for manufacture of biomass, biogas and biofuels, and use of these fuels in energy and transport are currently limited to advanced biofuels as per Article 2 (34) of the EU Renewable Energy Directive II (Directive (EU) 2018/2001). For other types of biofuels that are not advanced biofuels but may offer substantial climate mitigation benefits, the TEG request that the Platform undertake further work to consider establishing criteria for ensuring substantial contribution to climate mitigation. Similarly, the TEG recommends that the Platform undertake further work to consider establishing criteria for the manufacture of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin as defined by Article 2 (36) under the Directive (EU) 2018/2001, as this has been included in the Transport criteria of the Taxonomy.Any electricity generation technology can be included in the taxonomy if it can be demonstrated, using an ISO 14067 or a GHG Protocol Product Lifecycle Standard-compliant Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) assessment, that the life cycle impacts for producing 1 kWh of electricity are below the declining threshold.

Ensure any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems have been implemented. For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (COM (2011) 244), the Birds (2009/147/EC) and Habitats (92/43/EEC) Directives or in the case of activities located in non-EU countries, other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area. For such sites/operations, ensure that:  a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources;  all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats; and  a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented.Construction and operation of transmission Systems that transport the electricity on the extra high-voltage and high-voltage interconnected System. Construction and operation of distribution Systems that transport electricity on high-voltage, medium-voltage and low-voltage distribution Systems. Construction and operation of interconnections that transport electricity between separate Systems.Is dedicated to creating a direct connection, or expanding an existing direct connection between a power production plant that is more CO 2 intensive than 100 gCO2e/kWh, measured on a LCE basis, and a substation or network.These criteria will be subject to regular review, in line with reviews of generation threshold values and progress to decarbonisation. Based on the results of an assessment carried out in 2019 by the EU JRC, the interconnected European System meets the criteria above that define a system to be on a trajectory to full decarbonisation. It, and its subordinated systems, meetDirect connection, or expansion of existing direct connection, of low carbon electricity generation below the threshold of 100 gCO2e/kWh declining to 0g CO2e/kWh in 2050, measured on a PCF basis, to a substation or network.Installation of T&D transformers that comply with the Tier 2 (2021) requirements from Regulation 548/2014 on the eco-design of small, medium and large power transformers and, for medium power transformers with highest voltage for equipment not exceeding 36 kV, with AAA0 level requirements on no-load losses set out in standard EN 505881.To determine eligibility, it is possible to consider a System covering multiple control areas which are interconnected and with significant energy exchanges between them. In such a case, the weighted average emissions factor across all included control areas is used to determine eligibility, and individual subordinated transmission or distribution systems within this System will not be required to demonstrate compliance separately.It is possible for a System to become ineligible after having previously been eligible. In Systems that become ineligible, no new T&D activities are eligible from that moment onward, until the system is again in compliance with the threshold (except for those activities which are always eligible, see above). Activities in subordinated Systems may still be eligible, if these subordinated Systems meet the criteria of this Taxonomy.A direct connection or expansion of an existing direct connection to production plants includes infrastructure that is indispensable to carry the associated electricity from the power generating facility to a substation or network.Rationale Increasing access to electricity will support its decarbonisation by enabling more consumers to transition from carbon-intensive energy supply, while increasing the utilisation of renewable energy. As countries continue to fulfil their decarbonisation objectives, there will be fewer and fewer investments in transmission and distribution which are not climate aligned.Under this logic, we propose that most investments in electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure in Systems where a significant majority of new generation capacity is from low carbon generation sources should be considered climate-aligned under the EU Taxonomy. Do no significant harm assessment The impacts of transmission and distribution lines are a function of the spatial alignment of the grid, the structures and conductors required for various voltages, the extent to which pre-existing corridors are used, and how the transmission and distribution lines are operated and maintained. The most common environmental impacts of electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure are visual, ecosystem and land use. In the cases of underground offshore electricity lines, water and marine resources may be impacted.State ambition to maximise recycling at end of life based on BAT at time of decommissioning (e.g. through contractual agreements with recycling partners, reflection in financial projections or official project documentation).For construction site activities follow the principles of IFC General EHS Guideline.  Respect applicable norms and regulations to limit impact of electromagnetic radiation on human health. For Europe: The applicable guidelines in force in are the “Council recommendation on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz to 300 GHz)” (1999/519/EC). Outside Europe: 1998 ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection)261 Do not use PCBs Polyclorinated Biphenyls.

Eligibility criteria for Demand Side Management (load shedding and load shifting) activities are available under the transmission & distribution of electricity criteria. However, hydropower pumped storage shall comply with the criteria for “Production of Electricity from Hydropower”.Rationale Electricity Storage is defined according to article 2.59 of the recast Electricity Directive as: “In the electricity system, deferring the final use of electricity to a moment later than when it was generated, or the conversion of electrical energy into a form of energy which can be stored, the storing of such energy, and the subsequent reconversion of such energy into electrical energy or use as another energy carrier.“ Electricity storage can support the integration of renewable energy systems into electricity transmission and distribution. It can balance centralized and distributed electricity generation, while also contributing to energy security. It will supplement demand response and flexible generation and complement grid development. It can also contribute to the decarbonisation of other economic sectors and support the integration of higher shares of variable renewable energy (variable RES) in transport, buildings, or industry. At current levels of storage capacity available in European markets, all additional storage capacity should be beneficial to the EU climate change mitigation objectives (this will be subject to review in later taxonomy updates). Do no significant harm assessment The electricity storage activities differ considerably in their physical, chemical and biological bases and forms, which result in divergent environmental impacts in each case.

It could thus avoid the need to produce the thermal energy with fossil fuels. It can also contribute to the decarbonisation of other economic sectors and support the integration of higher shares of variable renewable energy (variable RES) in transport, buildings, or industry. At current levels of storage capacity available in European markets, all additional storage capacity should be beneficial to the EU climate change mitigation objectives.

For Anaerobic Digestion of Biowaste and Sewage Sludge, refer to activities 5.5 and 5.3 respectively. Any other anaerobic digestion of organic material (not covered under sections 5.3 and 5.5) is eligible provided that: - methane leakage from relevant facilities (e.g. for biogas production and storage, energy generation, digestate storage) is controlled by a monitoring plan. - the digestate produced is used as fertiliser/soil improver – directly or after composting or any other treatmentRationale The Manufacture of Biomass, Biogas and Biofuel can deliver mitigation benefits but, if done incorrectly can have no net positive impact or even a negative impact. Thus, the eligibility criteria are based on existing EU regulation but seek to advance the agenda by restricting eligibility to advanced bioenergy feedstocks. Do no significant harm assessment The key environmental aspects to be taken into account when investing in this activity are the impact on local water (consumption and sewage), the fulfilment of the applicable waste and recycling criteria, and the avoidance of direct impacts on sensitive ecosystems, species or habitats. For biomass feedstocks refer to Forestry Criteria and/or Crop criteria. (2) AdaptationIdentify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented.For biogas production: the resulting digestate meets the requirements for fertilising materials in Proposed Regulation COM (2016 ) 157 or national rules on fertilisers/ soil improvers for agricultural use or the conditions established by the competent authority for a safe use.Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with the EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment (2014/52/EU) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (2001/42/EC) or in the case of activities located in non-EU countries other equivalent national provisions or international standards for activities in non-EU countries (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations).

In case of AD plants treating over 100 t/day, emissions to air and water are within the Best Available Techniques – Associated Emission Levels (BATAEL) ranges set for anaerobic treatment of waste in the BREF for waste treatment. 262 In case of AD, emissions to air (e.g. SOx, NOx) after combustion of biogas are controlled, abated (when needed) and within the limits set by EU and respective national legislation.Retrofit of gas networks for the distribution of gaseous fuels through a system of mains. Retrofit of gas networks for long-distance transportation of gases by pipelines. The complete system must have been in place and operating for a minimum of 5 years.Retrofit of gas networks whose main purpose is the integration of captured CO 2 is eligible, if the operation of the pipeline meets the criteria outlined for the transportation of captured CO2. Gas network expansion is not eligible. Rationale Electrification of the energy sector will not be sufficient to fulfil the EU’s net-zero by 2050 target. Molecule-based energy will continue to have a role to play in the future energy supply. This is particularly pertinent to supporting the uptake of hydrogen but one with an enormous capacity to decarbonise the electricity, transport and manufacturing sectors. Do no significant harm assessment The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from retrofit and operation of existing gas distribution and supply networks that allow for the use of hydrogen and other lowcarbon gas systems are associated with: Retrofitting phase of the network: all aspects have to be considered that are usually connected with construction like terrestrial habitat alteration, loss of valuable ecosystems, land consumption, overburden disposal, negative impacts on biodiversity, emissions of particles and NOx, noise and hazardous materials. For larger projects an ESIA should be done.Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

For such sites/operations, ensure that:  a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources;Construction and operation of pipelines and associated infrastructure for distributing heating and cooling is currently eligible, if the system meets the definition of efficient district heat/cool systems in the EU Energy Efficiency Directive. The EU Energy Efficiency Directive defines “efficient district heating and cooling” as a district heating or cooling system using at least 50% renewable energy or 50% waste heat or 75% cogenerated heat or 50% of a combination of such energy and heat. The following activities are always eligible: Rationale Providing energy services in a low-carbon manner, particularly for heating and cooling distribution will require investments in newer and more efficient delivery models. The Taxonomy criteria on District Heating and Cooling Networks provide guidance that seeks to foster the market as a whole and ultimately lower the emissions intensity of the energy services that society needs. Do no significant harm assessment Key environmental aspects to be considered for the investments in Distribution of District Level Heating and Cooling are summarised as follow:Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

Ensure any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems have been implemented.The criterion is subject to regular review. Rationale Providing energy services in a low-carbon manner, particularly for heating and cooling distribution will require investments in newer and more efficient delivery models. Heat pumps are an energy efficient heating/cooling method. Heat pumps will play an important role in the European Union’s decarbonisation efforts. The Taxonomy criteria on the Installation and Operation of Heat Pumps, provide guidance that seeks to foster the market as a whole and ultimately lower the emissions intensity of the energy services that society needs. Do no significant harm assessment (2) AdaptationAny cogeneration technology can be included in the taxonomy if it can be demonstrated, using an ISO 14067 or a GHG Protocol Product Lifecycle Standard-compliant Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) assessment, that the life cycle impacts for producing 1 kWh of heat/cool and power are below the declining threshold. Declining threshold: The Cogeneration Threshold is the combined heat/cool and power threshold of 100 gCO2e/kWh. CSP is currently derogated from performing a PCF assessment, subject to regular review in accordance with the declining threshold. CSP is currently deemed to be taxonomy eligible, which is subject to regular review.Generation of Heat/Cool is covered under the Generation of Heat/Cool threshold Rationale Efficient and low-emissions cogeneration of heating/cooling and power will be required if Europe is to meet its net-zero by 2050 target. A power-to-heat ratio has been adopted to draw an equivalence between the declining emissions intensity threshold set on the production of electricity and that 260The construction of the installation and the substantial land-take associated with the installation  Impacts to birdlife from the high temperatures generated by the plant  Impacts of the cooling system on water resources Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation.

Declining threshold: The Cogeneration Threshold is the combined heat/cool and power threshold of 100 gCO2e/kWh. This threshold will be reduced every 5 years in line with a net-zero CO2e in 2050 trajectory  The threshold must be met at the point in time when taxonomy approval is sought for the first time  For activities which go beyond 2050, it must be technically feasible to reach net-zero emissions The full PCF assessment shall be subjected to review. Rationale Efficient and low-emissions cogeneration of heating/cooling and power will be required if Europe is to meet its net-zero by 2050 target. Production of heat/cool using waste heat as defined by the EU Energy Efficiency Directive Do no significant harm assessment The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from Production of electric energy from high-enthalpy geothermal system is associated with:Non-condensable geothermal gases with specific environmental threats, such as H 2S, CO2, and CH4, are often released from flash-steam and dry-steam power plants.

Hence the waste heat recovery system would not increase operational emissions.Waste heat is heat that is discarded by an existing industrial process.

However, advanced solid waste management has a great potential to trigger greenhouse gas emission reductions in other sectors of the economy through waste prevention, separate waste collection, waste reuse and recycling. What is covered In the waste sector, a systems approach describing the climate mitigation effects of an integrated package of closely interrelated and combined environmentally sustainable activities would have its merits. As, however, the scope of the Taxonomy subgroup was to define stand-alone activities, the chosen climate mitigation principles, metrics and thresholds were formulated in a way to allow for the assessment of singular activities without consideration of their linkages in a complex waste management system (respectively, waste hierarchy). The TEG and the experts involved assessed the NACE codes for WSWR and identified nine economic activities that offer a substantial contribution for climate mitigation: NACE Codes ‘E38.1.2 collection of hazardous waste’, ‘E38.2.2 treatment and disposal of hazardous waste’ and ‘E38.3.1 dismantling of wrecks’ (e.g. automobiles, ships, etc.) were found to be of less relevance from a climate mitigation perspective and thus reprioritized for later consideration by the Platform on Sustainable Finance (see section on ‘next steps’ further below).CCS facilitates the direct mitigation of both fossil and process emissions in many industrial sectors including steel, cement and chemicals. Time is a crucial factor: the later options for deep decarbonisation in an industry arise, the more costly they become, and the more likely the need for greater carbon dioxide removaleconomic activities promoting the reuse of products and/or preparing products for reuse through the establishment of reuse and repair networks and dedicated separate collection and reverse logistics systems;285 Benson, S.

By 2025 the Sustainable Finance Platform should assess the feasibility of Option 2, in particular with regard to the intended incentive for substantial energy efficiency improvements in water supply systems.by decreasing the average energy consumption of the system by at least 20% (including abstraction, treatment and distribution; measured in kwh per cubic meter billed/unbilled authorized water supply);to use more efficient sources in substitution of others more GHG demanding (e.g. surface sources instead groundwater sources, by means of water harvesting), more efficient pumping systems, frequency variators, digitalization and automation.An ILI of 1.5 represents a very efficient performance of the network with regards to water losses. ILI incorporates in its definition the length of the supply network, which makes it the most objective parameter. Water losses management (reduction of the ILI) reduces indirectly the energy consumption in the whole water supply system thus enabling significant reductions of GHG emissions from the water supply system. Water loss management measures consist inter alia of:       active leakage control, pressure management, speed and quality of repairs, infrastructure and assets management (including maintenance), metering, monitoring and reporting, digitalization and automation.296 The Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) is calculated as current annual real losses (CARL) / unavoidable annual real losses (UARL).

Rationale This activity considers collection and waste water treatment line in wastewater treatment plants. The sludge treatment is included in Taxonomy Activity “Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge”. From common practice (see 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas inventories) it is known that any level of treatment (primary, secondary, or tertiary) achieves substantial reductions of GHG emissions when compared with the emissions of the discharge of wastewater in the water bodies through on-site sanitation systems (such as pit latrines, septic tanks, anaerobic lagoons etc.). Do no significant harm assessment The main potential significant harm linked to this activity is related to:    Ensure emissions to water are within the ranges set in the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 91/271/EEC. Implement appropriate measures to avoid and mitigate combined sewer overflow in case of heavy rainfall, such as Nature-based solutions, separate rainwater collection systems, retention tanks and / or treatment of the first flush. Ensure sewage sludge is managed/used (e.g. anaerobic digestion, land application) according to relevant EU and respective national legislation.Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with the EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment (2014/52/EU) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (2001/42/EC) or in the case of activities located in non-EU countries other equivalent national provisions or international standards for activities in non-EU countries (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations). Ensure any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems have been implemented. For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (COM (2011) 244), the Birds (2009/147/EC) and Habitats (92/43/EEC) Directives or in the case of activities located in non-EU countries, other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area. For such sites/operations, ensure that: a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources; all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats; and a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented.methane leakage from relevant facilities (e.g. for biogas production and storage, energy generation, digestate storage) is controlled by a monitoring plan; the produced biogas is used directly for the generation of electricity and/or heat, or upgraded to bio-methane for injection in the natural gas grid, or used as vehicle fuel (e.g. as bioCNG) or as feedstock in chemical industry (e.g. for production of H2 and NH3).No threshold applies. Rationale Sewage sludge is a by-product of waste-water treatment, with organic and inorganic content. The organic content of the sludge is subject of decomposition which might occur under controlled circumstances (in sludge treatment installations) or under un-controlled circumstances in the final disposal, with significant GHG emissions (mainly methane). Anaerobic Digestion (AD) and in some cases aerobic digestion are examples of sludge treatments. In AD microorganisms decompose the organic matter of the sludge (in the absence of oxygen) and produce methane-rich biogas. The primary climate mitigation effect of biogas is it’s use a source of renewable energy in multiple forms and applications displacing fossil fuels. 297 As an additional contribution to climate mitigation the sludge can be turned into a recyclable product (e.g. as fertilizer substituting synthetic fertilizers).297 Canfora P., Antonopoulos I.

The most relevant emissions are resulting from the sludge storage as well as from the subsequent combustion of biogas, such as sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and particulates; the subsequent use of the resulting digestate as fertiliser / soil improver which may also result in soil and water pollution due to contaminants in the digestate.Emissions to air and water are within the Best Available Techniques – Associated Emission Levels (BAT-AELs)299 ranges set for anaerobic treatment of waste in the BREF for waste treatment. 300 Emissions to air (e.g. SOx, NOx) after combustion of biogas are controlled, abated (when needed) and within the limits set by EU and respective national legislation. If the resulting digestate is intended for use as fertiliser / soil improver, it must meet the national rules on fertilisers/soil improvers for agricultural use.298 IEA Bioenergy, 2017: Methane emissions from Biogas Plants (https://www.ieabioenergy.com/wpcontent/uploads/2018/01/Methane-Emission_web_end_small.pdf). 299 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018D1147&from=EN 300 https://eippcb.jrc.ec.europa.eu/reference/BREF/WT/JRC113018_WT_Bref.pdfNet GHG emission reductions through reuse and high quality recycling of waste, which are enabled by the separate collection and transport of source-segregated non-hazardous waste fractions. Reuse and recycling activities reduce GHG emissions by displacing alternative waste management options (e.g. landfilling and incineration) and alternative raw material sourcing options with higher GHG emission intensity.No threshold applies. Rationale This activity includes the collection of source segregated non-hazardous waste from households and businesses for the purpose of material recovery and bio-waste treatment in dedicated facilities (see Taxonomy Activities “Material recovery from non-hazardous waste”, “Anaerobic digestion of bio-waste” and “Composting of bio-waste”). Separate waste collection is a precondition for reuse and high quality recycling of waste, whose net GHG emission reduction is proven by pertinent studies.301 Additional GHG emissions resulting fromGerman Federal Environmental Agency (UBA), 2015: The Climate Change Mitigation Potential of Waste Management, sections 4.2.4 and 11.1 (Recovering dry recyclables, specific emission factors). https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/378/publikationen/texte_56_2015_the_climate_change_mitigation_pote ntial_of_the_waste_sector.pdf.

Co-digestion is eligible only with a minor share (up to 30% of the input feedstock) of advanced bioenergy feedstock listed in Annex IX of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. If energy crop feedstock covered302 For definition of bio-waste refer to Directive (EU) 2018/851 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste (Article 1(3)(b)). It comprises biodegradable garden and park waste, food and kitchen waste from households, offices, restaurants, wholesale, canteens, caterers and retail premises and comparable waste from food processing plants. 303 For definition of fertilising products refer to ANNEX I of Regulation EU 2019/1009 laying down rules on the making available on the market of EU fertilising products, amending Regulations (EC) No 1069/2009 and (EC) No 1107/2009 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003.Rationale Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a process by which microorganisms decompose biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. As part of an integrated waste management system, AD is a valid route to divert biodegradable waste from landfilling and thus reduce the uncontrolled emissions of landfill gas, in particular methane. The AD process produces methane-rich biogas under controlled conditions, and a sludge-like or liquid residue, termed ‘digestate’. Biogas can be used in multiple forms and applications that displace fossil fuels. The digestate is typically used on farmland as organic fertilizer, directly or after a composting step. The use of digestate instead of synthetic fertilizers derived from by-products of the petroleum industry saves energy and reduces the consumption of fossil fuels. Where there is no immediate use on farmland, the digestate can be dewatered and ‘cured’ by composting to stabilise the material, which can be stored for longer time and used as an organic fertiliser or soil improver. For the treatment of kitchen and food waste as well as other similar bio-waste, AD exhibits the best environmental and climate change mitigation performance compared to other forms of biological treatment and should therefore be given preference where it is technically and economically viable. This depends on several local conditions. 304 On the other hand, biodegradable garden and park wastes and other bio-waste with high ligneous content are typically not directly degradable by AD. Where such bio-waste fraction is significant, it should be collected separately and treated by composting (see Taxonomy Activity “Composting of bio-waste”). Co-digestion of bio-wastes with solid or liquid manure and other agricultural residues as well as energy crops is sometimes practised to improve the stability of the AD process and increase biogas yields and is eligible under the conditions mentioned in the metrics. Due care needs to be taken however to ensure that the use of the digestate (or composts produced therefrom) as a fertilizer/soil conditioner is not negatively affected by such practice. Methane leakage may offset the climate mitigation benefits and therefore needs to be avoided. Specific monitoring is therefore needed to detect methane leakages from relevant facilities. Where increasing methane emissions are detected, it is in the interest of the operator to remove the causes through technical or operational measures in order to minimize economic losses.305 Do no significant harm assessment The main potential significant harm linked to this activity is related to:304 Dri M., Canfora P., Antonopoulos I.

Composting makes organic matter more resilient to further degradation.

By 2025 the Sustainable Finance Platform should assess the feasibility of the principle, in particular with regard to the intended incentive to close landfills.the landfill has not been opened after [date of entry into force of Taxonomy]; the landfill (or landfill cell) where the system is newly installed (or extended and / or retrofitted) is permanently closed and is not taking further waste; the produced landfill gas is used directly for the generation of electricity and/or heat, or upgraded to bio-methane for injection in the natural gas grid, or used as vehicle fuel (e.g. as bioCNG) or as feedstock in chemical industry (e.g. for production of H2 and NH3); methane emissions from the landfill and leakages from the landfill gas collection and utilization facilities are controlled by a monitoring plan.No threshold applies. Rationale The activity is generally carried out as part of or complementary to the closure and remediation of old landfills.

Road, rail, aviation, and waterborne transport will all have to contribute to the reduction321. Currently transport operations consume one-third of all energy in the EU. The bulk of this energy comes from oil. This means that transport is responsible for a large share of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions and is a major contributor to climate change. While most other economic sectors, such as industry, have reduced their emissions since 1990, those from transport have risen (see Figure 1). Preliminary estimates from EU Member States show that GHG emissions from transport were 29% above 1990 levels in 2018322 They now account for more than one quarter of the EU’s total greenhouse gas emissions. This presents a major challenge in addressing transport sector emissions to ensure that the EU’s emission reduction target is met. Although vehicle efficiency improvements have had a mitigating effect on GHG emissions, growing transport demand323 and a sluggish share of low-carbon solutions have outweighed it.321 The European Green Deal, COM(2019) 640 final 322 https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/transport/term/increasing-oil-consumption-and-ghg 323 Passenger and freight transport demand: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/passenger-and-freight-transport-demand/assessment.324 Greenhouse gas emissions from transport: https://ec.europa.eu/transport/facts-fundings/statistics/pocketbook-2019_en 325 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Establishment of a Framework to Facilitate Sustainable Investment (COM (2018) 353 final). 326 '”A Clean Planet for All”.

For fleet efficiency criteria, tank-to-wheel criteria have been used since the basis for criteria is the Clean Vehicles Directive, the post-2020 CO2 Regulation for cars and vans and the Heavy Duty CO2 regulation. Life-cycle and well-to-wheel considerations for thresholds is pending on the possibility to develop and agree a common Union methodology in future as per the above mentioned legislations. Efficient, low- and zero direct emissions fleets This category of criteria requires that operated fleets to become more efficient over time by linking eligibility to emissions performance below a certain threshold set to ensure substantially reduced emissions. Thresholds are based on performance metrics (vehicle km, passenger km or tonne km). They are mode specific and are linked to available testing methods where available. They require efficiency improvements without being technology prescriptive, so long as the benefits of relevant technologies can be demonstrated. The operation of vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions, or close to zero tailpipe emissions, is automatically eligible in the proposed criteria. Vehicle/vessel electrification is the main category in this context. This approach is also motivated by ETS inclusion and the ongoing decarbonisation of the EU power sector.327 The European Green Deal, COM(2019) 640 final 328 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/41897/st14970-ad01-en19.pdf 329 '”A Clean Planet for All”.

It is acknowledged that for other regions the criteria proposed may not be applicable in defining substantial contributions to climate change mitigation. 331 There is no intention on the part of the TEG to undermine the approach in existing regulations covering these different aspects332 Taxonomy regulation Article 6.1.c: https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/41897/st14970-ad01-en19.pdf 333 The CO2 emissions from the use of biofuels are not counted in the total GHG emissions from the transport sector in EU’s official GHG inventory under the UNFCCC.

For other types of biofuels that are not advanced biofuels but may offer substantial climate mitigation benefits, the TEG request that the Platform undertake further work to consider establishing criteria for ensuring substantial contribution to climate mitigation.Maritime shipping has been considered by the TEG. Whilst it was evident that zero direct emissions fleets should be eligible as for other modes, criteria will also need to be established for short sea shipping where modal shift benefits can be achieved. Furthermore, it will be also important to consider approaches to maritime shipping based on the efficiency of transport fleets. Discussions in this area were not concluded during the timeframe of the TEG and should be continued in further work on the Taxonomy. Aviation was not considered within the scope of the work of the TEG but should be addressed in the future considering the significance of emissions from the sector. In addition, ICT transport specific solutions and transport demand management can be important measures for enabling mitigation that have not been included at this stage but warrant further study. For a number of criteria, a review period is recommended as detailed in the tables that follow. 326Demonstrate substantial GHG emission reduction by: Increasing the number of low- and zero emission fleets, and improving fleet efficiency Improving efficiency of the overall transport/mobility system  With the present energy mix, the overall emissions associated with zero direct emissions rail transport (i.e. electric or hydrogen) are among the lowest compared with other transport modes. The generation of the energy carriers used by zero direct emissions transport is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near futureThe threshold of 50 gCO2e/pkm until 2025 ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria for eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor (50 gCO2/vkm) and significantly lower than emissions for an average car in the current vehicle stock. Rationale Zero direct emissions rail (e.g. electric, hydrogen) is eligible because: With the present energy mix, the overall emissions associated with zero direct emissions rail transport (i.e. electric or hydrogen) are among the lowest compared with other transport modes.

It does not represent emissions per seat-km (capacity) but actual emissions per passenger-km, thus taking into account not only the technological component but also the operational efficiency of the system. Average load factor for diesel rail in EU is 24% or 24 passengers-km per 100 seats-km offered (source UIC 2010)Demonstrate substantial GHG emission reduction by: Increasing the number of low- and zero emission fleets, and improving fleet efficiency Improving efficiency of the overall transport/mobility system  Zero direct emissions trains (e.g. electric, hydrogen) are eligible. Other trains are eligible if direct emissions per tonne-km (gCO2e/tkm) are 50% lower than average reference CO2 emissions of HDVs as defined for the Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation, to be reviewed in 2025. Rail that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or fossil fuels blended with alternative fuels is not eligible even if meeting the criteria above.With the present energy mix, the overall emissions associated with zero direct emissions rail transport (i.e. electric or hydrogen) are among the lowest compared with other transport modes. The generation of the energy carriers used by zero direct emissions transport is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near futureThe threshold of 50% lower than average reference CO2 emissions of HDVs ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria for eligible road freight vehicles, with a review in 2025 to assess technology developments in the freight transport sector. The Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation uses a g CO2/km metric. To convert this to a g CO2/tonne-km metric, the average payload for the road freight vehicles should be applied. Once reference value data is available, it is expected that the taxonomy will specify CO2e/tkm threshold values. Rationale The carbon intensity of freight rail, even if diesel, is in most cases significantly lower than road freight transport, rail freight transport at least meeting the threshold proposed in the road transport HDV criteria is eligible.

Rationale The threshold of 50 gCO2e/pkm until 2025 ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria for eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor (50 gCO 2/vkm) and significantly lower than the average car (290 gCO2 /vkm343).

In total, electric vehicles represent 1 in 700 cars in Europe (0,15%) (EEA, 2016). A further uptake is expected in the next decades. There are various projections for the global EV stock in 2030, ranging between 60 and 200 million EVs, which would be between 4 and 14%. Worldwide (Bloomberg, 2018). Other sources indicate 125 million EVs, around 9% of global stock in 2030 (CNBC, 2018). In Europe, EC estimates between 20 and 70 million passenger cars in Europe by 2030. Projections on the quantity of vehicles indicate 200 million passenger cars in Europe in 2030 (PWC, 2018). This would mean that in 2030 in Europe between 10 and 35% of cars are electric. 346 ELV Directive 2000/53/EC (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/elv/index.htm); Promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles Directive (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2019-0427_EN.html?redirect), EU GPP criteria for road transport (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/eu_gpp_criteria_en.htm) and (https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/automotive/environment-protection/noise-reduction_en) 347 Indirect emissions to air from the production of fuels and energy carriers are a further impact, however, one that is out of the control of vehicles manufacturers and operators.Buses must comply with the current Euro VID and from 2022, the Euro VIE stage. Railcars, locomotives must comply with latest applicable standards (currently stage 5) of Non-Road Mobile Machinery Regulation348. Where applicable, tyres must comply with the (revised) Tyre labelling regulation349. It includes noise labelling requirements but not requirements on tyre abrasion. However, the proposal of revision envisages a test method to be developed: A suitable testing method to measure tyre abrasion is not currently available. Therefore, the Commission should mandate the development of such a method, taking into full consideration of all state-of-the-art internationally developed or proposed standards or regulations, with a view to establishing a suitable testing method as soon as possible. Where applicable, tyres must comply with the noise requirements set by Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 on type-approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles350. Vehicles must comply with Regulation (EU) No 540/2014 351 on the sound level of motor vehicles and of replacement silencing systems.

Infrastructure that is required for zero direct emissions transport (e.g. electric charging points, electricity grid connection upgrades, hydrogen fuelling stations or electric highways). 2. Infrastructure and equipment (including fleets) for active mobility (walking, cycling, e-bikes and e-scooters) 3. Infrastructure that is predominantly used for low-carbon transport if the fleet that uses the infrastructure meets the thresholds for direct emissions as defined in the relevant activity - measured in CO2 emissions per kilometre (gCO2/km), CO2e emissions per tonne-kilometre (gCO2e/tkm), or CO2e emissions per passenger-kilometre (gCO2e/pkm). . 4. Non-electrified rail infrastructure with an existing plan for electrification or use of alternatively powered trains. For all cases:  Only infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation of the transport service is eligible. Infrastructure that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or blended fossil fuels is not eligibleContamination of water during construction and unsustainable use of water during construction and operations Unsustainable use of resources during constructions, e.g. generation of high amount of waste, no recycling/reuse of construction waste Noise pollution can be relevant for both rolling stock and railway infrastructure as noise can be generated by both rolling stock and poor conditions of rail tracks.353 Construction of infrastructure can cause significant harm when taking place in protected areas or areas of high biodiversity values outside protected areas. Infrastructure can cause fragmentation and degradation of the natural and urban landscape due to the “barrier” effects of the infrastructure and can involve risks of wildlife accidents caused by collisions. Railway infrastructure (in particular tunnels) can cause change and degradation of hydromorphological conditions of water bodies and therefore have impacts on aquatic ecosystems.Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented.Re-use parts and use recycled material during the renewal, upgrade and construction of infrastructure. At least 80% (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the EU waste list) generated on the construction site must be prepared for re-use, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials. This can be achieved by executing the construction works in line with the good practice guidance laid down in the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol354.353 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:675304/FULLTEXT02 354 EU Construction and Demolition Waste Protocol. Available at https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/eu-construction-anddemolition-waste-protocol-0_enEnvironmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment (2014/52/EU) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (2001/42/EC) or other equivalent national provisions.Such impact assessments should, at the very least, identify, evaluate, and mitigate any potential negative impacts of the designated activities, projects, or assets on ecosystems and its biodiversity and should be assessed and conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Habitats and Birds Directives. Invasive plants are appearing very often along transport infrastructure and are sometimes even spread duo to transport infrastructure, which might negatively impact natural ecosystems (e.g. natural fauna). Care should be taken not to spread any invasive plants through proper maintenance. Wildlife collisions is a problem and should be considered. Solutions developed for should be applied for the detection and avoidance of potential traps that may cause the unnecessary death of animals.Zero tailpipe emission vehicles (incl. hydrogen, fuel cell, electric). These are automatically eligible. Vehicles with tailpipe emission intensity of max 50 g CO2/km (WLTP) are eligible until 2025. From 2026 onwards only vehicles with emission intensity of 0g CO2/km (WLTP) are eligible.For category L vehicles: Zero tailpipe emission vehicles (incl. hydrogen, fuel cell, electric). Brief rationale: Zero direct emissions vehicles (e.g. electric, hydrogen) are eligible because the generation of the energy carriers used by zero tailpipe emissions vehicles is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future Vehicles with tailpipe emission intensity of max 50 g CO2/km (WLTP) are eligible until 2025 because the post-2020 CO2 Regulation for cars and vans sets this threshold as an ambitious mid-term target that is significantly below the expected average emissions of new cars and vans. The 50 g CO 2/km threshold does not apply to L vehicles (e.g. motorcycles) due to their lower weight and high electrification potential. Rationale This activity includes operation of all vehicles classified as M1, N1, as defined by Regulation (EU) 2018/858, and of vehicles classified as category L (2- and 3-wheel vehicles and quadricycles) as defined in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013. It also applies to NACE code 49.32 Taxi operation, NACE code 53.10 Postal activities under universal service obligation, NACE code 53.20 Other postal and courier activities, and NACE 77.11 Rental and leasing of cars and light motor vehicles where these activities may include the operation of eligible vehicles. 339The revised Directive includes ambitious and binding procurement targets for each EU member state using harmonized definition what a clean-vehicle is. The notion of clean-vehicle is principally aligned with aim of the Taxonomy and the proposed Art 6.1.c (above). The transition element is also built into the CVD. The relevant definitions for light duty vehicles are aligned with the post-2020 CO2 Regulation for cars and vans. Taken together, these two pieces of EU legislation reflect the latest thinking on ambitious and sufficiently mature performance metrics. The potential for synergies is significant when the Taxonomy is aligned to the legislative thresholds for clean vehicles. It will reduce market uncertainty in terms of what are green vehicles to manufacture and operate- both from the demand and supply side. Life-cycle and well-to-wheel considerations for thresholds is pending on the feasibility to develop and agree a common Union methodology: The Clean Vehicles Directive acknowledges that life-cycle and well-to-wheel emission are to be addressed at a later point in time (recital 31): The possible reflection of life cycle CO 2 emissions and of well-to-wheel CO2 emissions of vehicles for the period after 2030 should be considered taking into account relevant provisions of Union law for their calculation at that point in time. By 31 December 2027, the Commission should review the implementation of Directive 2009/33/EC. In its review the Commission should also assess, inter alia, the possibility of aligning this Clean Vehicles Directive to any methodology for counting life-cycle CO2 emissions and well-to-wheel CO2 emissions developed in the context of EU vehicle CO2 emission performance standards. The new CO2 Regulation for cars and vans (EU) 2019/631 mandates in Art. 7 (10) that: The Commission shall no later than 2023 evaluate the possibility of developing a common Union methodology for the assessment and the consistent data reporting of the full life-cycle CO2 emissions of light duty vehicles that are placed on the Union market. The Commission shall transmit that evaluation, including where appropriate proposals for follow-up measures, such as legislative proposals, to the European Parliament and the Council.

Compliance with Directive 2000/53/EC ("End-of-life of vehicles Directive") Vehicles must comply with the emission thresholds for clean light-duty vehicles in Table 2 in the Annex of Directive (EU) 2019/1161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 amending Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles Tyres must comply with the (revised) Tyre labelling regulation 355. It includes noise labelling requirements but not requirements on tyre abrasion. However, the proposal of revision envisages a test method to be developed: A suitable testing method to measure tyre abrasion is not currently available. Therefore, the Commission should mandate the development of such a method, taking into full consideration all state-ofthe-art internationally developed or proposed standards or regulations, with a view to establishing a suitable testing method as soon as possible.

Dedicated vehicles solely using advanced biofuels or renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin as defined in Art. 2 (34) and Art. 2 (36) as well as low indirect land-use change-risk biofuels as defined in Art 2(37) in line with Directive (EU) 2018/2001), guaranteed either by technological design or ongoing monitoring and third-party verification. In addition, for an investment in new vehicles, only vehicles with efficiency corresponding to direct CO 2 emissions (gCO2/ km) (biogenic CO2) below the reference CO2 emissions of all vehicles in the same sub-group are eligible. Eligibility should be reviewed latest by 2025.or when Directive (EU) 2018/2001) is reviewed. Fleets of vehicles dedicated to transport fossil fuels or fossil fuels blended with alternative fuels are not eligible.Brief rationale: Road freight transport with zero direct emissions vehicles (e.g. electric, hydrogen) is eligible because the generation of these energy carriers is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future. The definition is aligned with the heavy duty CO2 regulation, which provides the most recent legislative point of orientation. Road freight transport with low-emission heavyduty vehicles defined in the same regulation and dedicated vehicles solely using a narrowly defined range of bio- or other renewable fuels are also eligible due to the relatively high challenges in electrifying this vehicle category. Substantial contribution to climate mitigation from fuel substitution is in line with the agreed taxonomy regulation. 343Direct emissions to air from the exhaust gases of internal combustion engine: nitrogen oxides (NOx ), total hydrocarbon (THC), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM) and particle number, and from tyre abrasion and brakes friction and noise emissions .

Dedicated vehicles solely using advanced biofuels or renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin as defined in Art. 2 (34) and Art. 2 (36) in line with Directive (EU) 2018/2001), guaranteed either by technological design or ongoing monitoring and third-party verification. In addition, for an investment in new vehicles, only vehicles with efficiency corresponding to direct emissions below 95g CO2 e /pkm (including biogenic CO2) are eligible Eligibility should be reviewed latest by 2025, or when Directive (EU) 2018/2001) is reviewed. Other vehicles are eligible if direct emissions are below 50 gCO 2e/pkmBrief rationale: Passenger transport with zero tailpipe emissions vehicles (e.g. electric, hydrogen) is eligible because the generation of these energy carriers is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future. Dedicated vehicles solely using a narrowly defined range of bio- or other renewable fuels are also eligible due to the relatively high challenges in electrifying the vehicle category typically used on interurban routes. Substantial contribution to climate mitigation from fuel substitution is in line with the agreed taxonomy regulation. The threshold of 50gCO2e/pkm relates to the thresholds set for passenger cars (assuming occupancy of one) and represents a value that is significantly below average new car emissions. Rationale The threshold of 50 gCO2e/pkm until 2025 ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria for eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor (50 gCO 2/vkm) and significantly lower than average diesel car (290 gCO2/vkm367). The criteria is based on actual ridership (passenger-km) and not capacity offered (seat-km or places-km). This should be justified through real monitoring data from operations or ex-ante demand assessments. Unlike urban buses, zero tailpipe emission vehicle technologies are not commercially available, therefore the threshold should be reviewed in or prior to 2025, rather than specifying now that only zero direct emissions will be eligible at that point, to analyze the modal shift comparison with cars in interurban transport, and technology developments in the sector. With no commercial availability of zero tailpipe emission vehicles for this activity, fuel substitution to advanced biofuels and renewable synthetic fuels are considered a relevant mitigation option for some transport modes in the medium term as identified in the EC Long term strategy368: “for those transport modes where the deployment of zero emission vehicles is unfeasible due to energy density requirements or technology costs, carbon neutral fuels (i.e. advanced biofuels and biomethane, as well as e-fuels) can be deployed for use in conventional vehicle engines”.367 The factor represents urban operational emissions for the current average car in the vehicle stock (weighting the share of diesel, petrol, LPG, CNG, hybrid in the fleet). It does not represent emissions of new vehicles.

However, the proposal of revision envisages a test method to be developed: A suitable testing method to measure tyre abrasion is not currently available. Therefore, the Commission should mandate the development of such a method, taking into full consideration all state-of-the-art internationally developed or proposed standards or regulations, with a view to establishing a suitable testing method as soon as possible.

In addition, for an investment in new vessels, only vessels with efficiency corresponding to direct emissions below 95g CO2 e /pkm (including biogenic CO2) are eligible. . Eligibility should be reviewed latest by 2025, or when Directive (EU) 2018/2001) is reviewed.Other Inland waterways vessels are eligible if direct emissions are below 50 gCO2e emissions per passenger kilometre (gCO2e/pkm) (or 92.6 g per passenger nautical mile (gCO2e/pnm)). Eligibility should be reviewed in 2025.With the present energy mix, the overall emissions associated with zero direct emissions rail transport (i.e. electric or hydrogen) are among the lowest compared with other transport modes. The generation of the energy carriers used by zero direct emissions transport is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near futureThe threshold of 50 gCO2e/pkm until 2025 (when it will be reviewed) ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria for eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor (50 gCO2/vkm) and significantly lower than emissions for an average car in the current vehicle stock.376 https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/docs/pages/com_2018_733_analysis_in_support_en_0.pdf 377 The CO2 emissions from the use of biofuels are not counted in the total GHG emissions from the transport sector in EU’s official GHG inventory under the UNFCCC.

In addition, for an investment in new vessels, only vessels with efficiency corresponding to direct CO2 emissions (gCO2/ tkm) (including biogenic CO2) below the average reference value defined for HDVs (Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation) are eligible.

Other inland waterway vessels are eligible if direct emissions per tkm CO2e emissions per tonne kilometre (gCO2e/tkm) or per tonne nautical mile (gCO2e/tnm) are 50% lower than the average reference value defined for HDVs (Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation). Eligibility should be reviewed in 2025. Vessels that are dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or any blended fossil fuels are not eligible even if meeting the criteria aboveWith the present energy mix, the overall emissions associated with zero direct emissions rail transport (i.e. electric or hydrogen) are among the lowest compared with other transport modes. The generation of the energy carriers used by zero direct emissions transport is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near futureThe threshold of 50% lower than average reference CO2 emissions of HDVs ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria for eligible road freight vehicles, with a review in 2025 to assess technology developments in the freight 353Substantial contribution to climate mitigation from fuel substitution is in line with the agreed taxonomy regulation. Rationale The threshold of 50% of the HDV reference value relates to the thresholds set for road freight vehicles and freight rail. If inland freight water transport operations can at least match the thresholds of those modes, it is deemed to be making a substantial contribution as it is significantly lower emissions than average road freight emissions. The threshold should be reviewed in or prior to 2025, rather than specifying now that only zero direct emissions will be eligible at that point, to analyse the modal shift comparison with cars, and technology developments in the sector. Transport of fossil fuels is considered to have potential negative impacts on climate change and therefore is excluded. With limited availability of zero tailpipe emission fleets for this activity, fuel substitution to advanced biofuels and renewable synthetic fuels are considered a relevant mitigation option for some transport modes in the medium term. The EC Long term strategy 386. The operation of fleets where fossil fuels are substituted with low- or net-zero carbon fuels such as advanced bio- and synthetic fuels can make a substantial contribution to CO 2 net emissions savings in the transport sector.387,388,389,390 This criteria only applies for vessels that have a specified minimum level of efficiency. The criteria for producing these fuels are set elsewhere in the Taxonomy. As an example of how this might work in practice, an operator may seek to operate a new or existing fleet solely using an eligible fuel (e.g. advanced fuel). To meet the Taxonomy criteria, the operator would need to demonstrate through ongoing verification that the fleet was solely using biofuels as specified in the criteria. A financier may be able to claim its investment (e.g. in a new fleet) was Taxonomy eligible through a contractual agreement with an operator to solely use biofuels, also establishing a verification system to enable ongoing monitoring.

Infrastructure that is required for zero direct emissions water transport (e.g. batteries or hydrogen fuelling facilities) is eligible 2. Infrastructure dedicated to supporting the renewable energy sector 3. Infrastructure that is predominantly used for low-carbon transport is eligible if the fleet that uses the infrastructure meets the thresholds for direct emissions as defined in the relevant activity - measured in CO2e emissions per passenger-kilometre (gCO2e/pkm),per tonne-kilometre (gCO2e/tkm), per passenger nautical mile (gCO2e/pnm) or per tonne nautical mile (gCO2e/tnm). 396 For all cases:  Only infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation of the transport service is eligible. Infrastructure that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or blended fossil fuels is not eligibleBrief rationale The construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon water transport is considered eligible because this is considered a key enabling factor for improving the uptake of the transport activities that are considered eligible under the rest of the land transport section of the Taxonomy. Eligibility for infrastructure is linked to396 At this stage, only criteria for inland waterway transport passenger and freight fleets are defined. The criteria for infrastructure could not be applied to non-zero direct emissions maritime shipping fleets until criteria for that type of activity is defined.Re-use parts and use recycled material during the renewal, upgrade and construction of water projects. At least 80% (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the EU waste list) generated on the construction site must be prepared for re-use, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials. This can be achieved by executing the construction works in line with the good practice guidance laid down in the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol397.Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment (2014/52/EU) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (2001/42/EC) or other equivalent national provisions.Such impact assessments should, at the very least, identify, evaluate, and mitigate any potential negative impacts of the designated activities, projects, or assets on ecosystems and its biodiversity and should be assessed and conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Habitats and Birds Directives including the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, as well as the Water Framework Directive (in particular ensuring conditions outlined in article 4(7) of the WFD are met.Why is ICT included in the Taxonomy Analysis by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) on the EU ICT sector398 – based on 2015 data – assesses that its Value Added amounted to 581 billion euros, it employed 5.8 million people, spent 30 billion euros on R&D, and represented 3.9% of the EU value added, 2.5% of total employment, and 15.7% of total R&D. The ICT service sector in particular represented 3.6% of GDP. In general, the ICT sector in 2015 was more dynamic than the whole EU economy, as value added increased 5.2%, employment 1.8% and R&D 2.9% However, based on the estimates published by the “European Framework Initiative for Energy & Environmental Efficiency in the ICT Sector”399 ICT currently accounts for 8-10% of the European electricity consumption. The demand for telecommunications services is consistently growing. It IP traffic (data through telecom networks) has been estimated to be growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 26 percent from 2017 to 2022.400 Subjects covered The analysis carried out here focuses on NACE sector J – Information and Communication, which does not include electronics manufacturing. The TEG has analysed the sector from two angles: Comments received for the activities proposed as areas for further work are discussed in the relevant sections below. Setting criteria and thresholds Data centres The JRC estimated total annual energy consumption of data centres in Western Europe as 56 TWh (or 2% of the total electricity consumption) per year. In 2012, this was projected to increase to 104 TWh (or 4%) per year by 2020. The large consumption of energy is due to the need for permanent storage of data (24 hour availability, back-up generators, etc.) and the need for cooling of the servers and other equipment to maintain optimal operating temperatures 401. Considering this economic activity’s dependence on electricity, in a long-term scenario of decarbonized but limited energy from the grid, the sector mitigation potential has been identified in high standards of energy efficiency rather than in low carbon footprints. Given the complexity of data centres – which encompass hardware, software, cooling systems, monitoring and back-up energy systems, only to name a few components – and the trade-offs that are present in the industry between energy efficiency and reliability and security, the TEG has opted for a comprehensive approach setting as “threshold” for significant contribution to mitigation a data centre compliance with the more advanced standard of energy efficiency available for this sector, the Best Practice Guidelines for the EU Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency (JRC) updated every year by the Commission to take account of technological advances402. Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions Despite the almost negligible contribution to the economy, data driven solution for data collection, transmission and modelling of GHG emissions reductions-related information plays an important enabling role. Given the nature of the activity, no threshold are necessary. Next steps The TEG recommends that the Commission undertakes work on the following activities.JRC, Best Environmental Management Practice in the Telecommunications and ICT Services Sector, 2016 available at http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/activities/emas/documents/TelecomICT_BEMP_BackgroundReport.pdf 402Based on this alternative approach, threshold should for example be set in terms of “attaining at least 15% energy saving compared to the energy consumption measured before the eligible project was implemented”. The EU could explore the option to adjust the 10% threshold, in the context of the whole Taxonomy.See for examples Operational energy Efficiency for Users (OEU); Technical Global KPIs for Fixed Access Networks (ETSI) available at https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/OEU/001_099/012/01.01.01_60/gs_OEU012v010101p.pdf Or the ETSI ES 203 228 V1.2.1 (2017-04): Environmental Engineering (EE); Assessment of mobile network energy efficiency (ETSI) available at https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/203200_203299/203228/01.02.01_60/es_203228v010201p.pdfStakeholders have also flagged the possibility to use avoided emissions to inform thresholds. However, in the absence of established benchmarks for the accounting of avoided emissions for these sectors as part of the EU PEF and OEF harmonised methodology for the calculation of the environmental footprint of products and organisations methods, this should be left to future iterations of the Taxonomy.Further examples mentioned by stakeholders include services based on connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud or Big Data can lead to a more efficient use of energy and can contribute to mitigating climate change effects through: - improving the efficiency of farming methods and increasing yields; - more effective monitoring and management of electricity use, heating and cooling; - enabling a more efficient distributed system of low carbon energy generation and smart grids; - using smart devices or digital services that enable individuals to have lower carbon lifestyles; - improving logistics, vehicle use, vehicle efficiency and use of public transportation; - enabling more effective remote working or education, thus avoiding travel and commuting; - and even through the replacement of physical products by digital services.Storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission or reception of diversity of data through data centres, including edge computing. Data centres include the following equipment:      The data centre implements the European Code of Conduct for Data Centre Energy Efficiency. This implies Implementation of the practices - including relevant optional ones where reasonable - described in the most recent “Best Practice Guidelines for the European Code of Conduct for Data Centre Energy Efficiency “ (JRC) or in CEN/CENELEC documents CLC TR50600-99-1 and CLC TR50600-99-2”.Rationale Rationale for energy efficiency versus emission reduction as mitigation principle: low or zero emissions can be achieved by sourcing electricity from renewable sources, from the grid or on site. Given the mounting competition for renewable energy, an expected greening of the energy system, and the projected growth of electricity consumption deriving from the digitalisation of the economy, inclusion in the Taxonomy will only depend on energy efficiency. Reference standard: 2019 Best Practice Guidelines for the EU Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency (JRC) available at https://e3p.jrc.ec.europa.eu/publications/2019-best-practiceguidelines-eu-code-conduct-data-centre-energy-efficiency This EU code of conduct is also the basis for the CEN/CENELEC documents CLC TR50600-99-1 and CLC TR50600-99-2 (on data centre energy efficiency and data centre environmental sustainability respectively). Geographical scope: Europe. Do no significant harm assessment 363The production of servers, storage devices and network technology also consumes a great deal of energy and thus emits CO2. The equipment used should meet the requirements of the EU Ecodesign Directive for servers and data storage products. When electrical and electronic equipment reaches its end of service, the waste electrical and electronic equipment is collected and managed by an authorised operator and treated according to the waste hierarchyDevelopment and/or use of ICT solutions that are aimed at collecting, transmitting, storing data and at its modelling and use when these activities are exclusively aimed at the provision of data and analytics for decision making (by the public and private sector) enabling GHG emission reductions.The option to adopt a threshold for multi-purpose solutions (eg. “50% of activity has to be applied to climate change”) has been considered but turned down not to incur behavioural issues (related to the lack of control over the use of the data and analytics by the end user)Example: Advanced weather forecasting models tailored to integrating more renewables in electricity generation. Digital technologies, such as machine-learning algorithms, when applied to weather and power plant output data, can increase the accuracy of renewable forecasts to up to 94%, from around 88% across the industryGeographical scope: Global. Do no significant harm assessment Activities falling in this category are mostly based on small-scale data processing and storage, with negligible physical impacts. (2) AdaptationPreamble In the EU, buildings are effectively the largest energy consuming sector, responsible for around 40% of energy consumption and 36% of carbon emissions. 407 At the same time, embodied carbon emissions are increasing and receiving growing attention. About three-quarters of European buildings are considered inefficient, while only 0.4-1.2% (depending on the country) of the building stock is renovated each year to improve its efficiency408. Renovation rates must be increased in order to set the whole building stock on a net-zero emissions pathway, while embodied and operational carbon emissions of new buildings must be significantly reduced in order to minimise their impact over their life cycle. At the same time, designing and renovating buildings to high energy performance standards is not sufficient to ensure low carbon emissions during operations, thus more needs to be done to address the ‘performance gap’ 409 of efficient buildings. Within this context, the TEG acknowledged the need for an ambitious approach and the crucial role that the taxonomy can play in directing financial flows towards the decarbonisation of the built environment. Subjects covered The taxonomy distinguishes four ‘economic activities’ and defines consistent mitigation criteria that enable assessing the eligibility of investments in construction and real estate on the basis of their potential impact on building energy performance and thus carbon emissions. The four activities are designed to be relevant to most real estate market participants and facilitate investment flows to mitigation measures in the building sector: 1. Construction of new buildings: this activity covers real estate development and enables accounting of: a. project capital expenditures of developers and construction clients as eligible ‘low-carbon activities’; b. turnover of developers and contractors. 2. Building renovation: this activity covers comprehensive renovation and enables accounting of: a. project capital expenditures for renovation as eligible ‘transition activities’. i. When expenditures can be distinguished by type, at least 50% must be related to energyefficiency measures in order to consider the renovation expenditures as eligible in their entirety. 410 ii. When expenditures cannot be distinguished by type, 50% of the total renovation expenditures may be counted as the proxy representing energy-efficiency measures.407 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-performance-of-buildings 408 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/eu-buildings-database 409 https://www.carbontrust.com/media/81361/ctg047-closing-the-gap-low-carbon-building-design.pdf 410 Certain types of financial instruments such as loans for acquisition and renovation of buildings may need to consider acquisition costs integrally with the eligible renovation costs if these costs cannot be practically separated in those types of financial instruments.The lack of consistent and comparable data across countries for benchmarking building stock performance and setting suitable thresholds for the top performing buildings within the respective national stock. The inherent difficulty of creating a level playing field across countries with different climates and degrees of market readiness. Compared to other economic activities, the operation of individual buildings has unique characteristics, which means the performance of different assets cannot easily be compared. Due to climatic differences across regions, buildings in different locations have different energy needs for heating, air conditioning and lighting, and therefore different potential to contribute to climate change mitigation. Furthermore, the nature of the existing building stock varies significantly from country to country, and even from region to region, due to differences in design, construction techniques and building age. The desire to find a compromise between rising ambition and building upon already existing ‘green’ financing instruments. The financing of buildings and building energy improvements is the most developed segment of the green finance market, and the ownership of buildings in portfolios is an extensively practiced economic activity. As the Taxonomy is introduced to the market, it is important to maintain the volume of existing investors and enable them to use the Taxonomy to evaluate their portfolios. The intention to direct finance towards new buildings designed to higher standards than mandatory design and construction requirements, considering the varying levels of ambition and rigor regarding the implementation of nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB) across EU Member States. 411The necessity to acknowledge existing high-performing buildings built before 2021 through a practical best-in-class approach, due to a lack of transparency on national performance requirement levels. The urgent need to increase the number of energy renovations, especially in private households.The need to foster energy-efficient operations of buildings through performance monitoring and reporting, while considering practicality and privacy requirements. The need to ensure minimum safeguards across the building life cycle through DNSH criteria by adopting EU and international standards and considering the practical implications of demonstrating taxonomy eligibility across different building type and activities. The current inability of significant parts of the market to operate with carbon metrics, as well as the need to progress towards the adoption of such metrics in conjunction with energy metrics.Setting criteria for new constructions to raise above mandatory design requirements and progress towards net-zero emissions in the use phase by 2030, and work to introduce a requirement on including embodied carbon.Setting criteria to direct finance towards a large volume of major renovation projects as well as towards individual measures aimed at improving energy and carbon performance. Adopting a best-in-class approach to ensure that the acquisition and ownership criteria support both significant market uptake and sufficient environmental benefits. Encouraging buyers to acquire efficient buildings over less-efficient ones can also provide an opportunity to support substantial contribution to climate mitigation by increasing the demand for such buildings and by enabling buyers to consume less energy during the use phase. The TEG considers that the best-in-class approach can be approximated by benchmarking the top performing 15% of the existing national stock. This performance level is intended to decline following 2050 decarbonisation targets. The performance of the top performing 15%of the national stock needs to be transposed into absolute energy or carbon metrics, but the TEG considered that data is not yet adequately available.Requiring improvements over time to ensure overall stock decarbonisation. The TEG is aware that there will be limited long-term impact in terms of emission reductions if the market simply trades financial exposure in the top 15% of national stocks without improving the energy efficiency of such buildings through renovation. In fact, there may be a risk of undermining renovation efforts if financing acquisition becomes less onerous than financing energy efficiency measures. For this reason, the TEG recommends introducing a requirement to renovate assets that are acquired though financial instruments that have long tenure periods.These principles led the TEG to develop the following criteria to identify environmentally sustainable activities in terms of Substantial Contribution to Climate Change Mitigation: 1. Construction of new buildings: to be eligible, the design and construction of new buildings needs to ensure a net primary energy demand that is at least 20% lower than the level mandated by national regulations. This is assessed through the calculated energy performance of the building, i.e. performance forecasted on the basis of modelling building physics under typical climatic and occupancy conditions.With regards to the criteria established for Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to the other 5 environmental objectives, in the interest of practicality and ease of market application the TEG has opted to rely on EU policy and regulations when possible. The TEG is conscious that the DNSH criteria to climate change adaptation requires extensive clarification in terms of its implementation in practice. Market coverage Except for buildings used for the extraction, storage, transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels, the taxonomy does not exclude any particular type of building, and therefore covers virtually the whole market for construction and real estate activities 413. This does not mean that every activity will be eligible, only that any participant in the market can use the taxonomy to assess the eligibility of his/her investments related to buildings. The Mitigation criteria will impact EU Member States differently as the share of the market eligible under the taxonomy will vary from location to location due to differences in the ‘levels of ambition’ established by national regulations (definition of NZEB and minimum energy performance requirements and implementation of the EPBD) for new and existing buildings undergoing and renovations. Buildings in countries with a highly decarbonised electricity grid will have an inherent advantage in delivering net-zero carbon buildings.412 According to Article 7 of the EPBD buildings undergoing major renovation must meet the cost-optimal minimum energy performance requirements. 413 With the exemption of Article 4, paragraph 4 of the EPBD which allows EU Member States to exclude specific types of buildings from the applying the minimum energy performance requirements.The Sustainable Finance Platform should establish a timeline for reviewing the 20% relative improvement from NZEB requirements (which applies to the ‘Construction of new buildings’), in conjunction with the expected updates of NZEB regulations by EU Member States, and with the clear objective of converging towards net-zero energy and net-zero carbon targets for new buildings by 2030. Such targets are aligned with the strategies of the World Green Building Council 414, the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction415 and other organisations416. Buildings built between 2021 and 2050 will represent up to 23% of the total stock in 2050 417. If the entire stock is meant to be net-zero carbon by 2050, it follows that those buildings built between 2021 and 2050 must be net-zero carbon in order for the overall target to be met. The sooner new buildings are built with net-zero performance, the less difficult it will be to meet the 2050 target for the whole sector to be net-zero. Since the TEG recommends working towards the introduction of net-zero carbon only after 2030, this already constitutes a compromise between the urgent need to eliminate emissions from new constructions and the capacity of the real estate sector to deliver net-zero carbon buildings. Considering the updates of NZEB regulations by EU Member States (expected in 2023 and 2028), the timeline for the Sustainable Finance platform could be as follows: oWhere net-zero carbon is already mandated by regulation (as may be the case for some building types in some Member States), the taxonomy should not require better performance, since netzero carbon can be considered sufficient (from the side of new constructions) to allow the entire building stock to be climate-neutral by 2050. By the end of 2024, the Sustainable Finance Platform should establish absolute thresholds for energy and carbon emissions to represent the performance of the top 15% of national stocks and provide a clear decarbonisation pathway as threshold for assessing the acquisition and ownership of assets built before 2021. By then, the performance of the top 15% of each national stock will have been converted into absolute thresholds for energy and carbon emissions. Until 31 December 2025, the top 15% of the national stock represents the performance level required to be eligible, From that date onward, and every five years afterwards, the performance level should be lowered to reflect a pathway reaching net-zero operational carbon in 2050. Such pathway could look as follows: oThe Sustainable Finance Platform should consider how to address long-term eligibility, i.e. assets covered by financial instruments with a tenure period of ten years or more. These assets could be required to be renovated in order to maintain eligibility. For example, there could be a requirement for renovations to occur within 15 years from the acquisition date.The Sustainable Finance Platform should provide guidance on the practical implementation of the DNSH criteria to climate change adaptation, especially for the activity of building renovation taking into account the need to avoid disproportionate administrative and financial burden.The Sustainable Finance Platform should develop appropriate criteria and thresholds to address Scope 1 emissions of construction companies, i.e. emission that are associated with the operation of such firms and the associated construction works.The construction of new buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbon emissions throughout the lifecycle can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation by saving large part of the energy and carbon emissions that would be associated with conventionally designed buildings. Condition for non-eligibility: to avoid lock-in and undermining the climate mitigation objective, the construction of new buildings designed for the purpose of extraction, storage, transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels is not eligible. Use of alternative schemes as proxies: outside EU Member States, established schemes such as ‘green building’ certifications or building regulations and standards may be used as alternative proof of eligibility, provided that this is verified by the Sustainable Finance Platform. The organisation responsible for the scheme will be able to apply for official recognition of its scheme by presenting evidence that a specific level of certification/regulation can be considered equivalent (or superior) to the taxonomy mitigation and DNSH threshold for the relevant climatic zone and building type. The Sustainable Finance Platform will assess the evidence and approve or reject the application.The metric is Primary Energy Demand (PED), defining the energy performance of a building: the annual primary energy demand associated with regulated energy use during the operational phase of the building life-cycle (i.e. ‘module B6’ as defined in EN15978), calculated ex-ante according to the national methodologies for asset design assessment, or as defined in the set of standards ISO 52000, expressed as kWh/m2 per year. The threshold is based on ‘nearly zero-energy building’ (NZEB) requirements, which are defined in national regulation implementing the EPBD and are mandatory for all new buildings across EU Member States from 2021. To be eligible, the net primary energy demand of the new construction must be at least 20% lower than the primary energy demand resulting from the relevant NZEB requirements.418 This reduction can be met through a direct decrease of theThe PED is either directly expressed by NZEB requirements or is derived by applying those requirements and calculating the resulting PED. When NZEB requirements specify a PED, the percentage improvement should be applied to this figure. 418Lack of resistance to extreme weather events (including flooding), and lack of resilience to future temperature increases in terms of internal comfort conditions.

Condition for non-eligibility: to avoid lock-in and undermining the climate mitigation objective, the renovation of buildings occupied for the purpose of extraction, storage, transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels is not eligible. Use of alternative schemes as proxies: outside EU Member States, established schemes such as “green building” certifications or building regulations and standards may be used as alternative proof of eligibility, provided that this is verified by the Sustainable Finance Platform.

The Sustainable Finance Platform will assess the evidence and approve or reject the application.The thresholds used to assess the renovation rely on either the respective metrics set in the applicable building energy performance regulation for ‘major renovation’ transposing the EPBD, or, in the case of relative improvement, on Primary Energy Demand (PED) defined as follows: the annual primary energy demand associated with regulated energy use during the operational phase of the building life-cycle (i.e. ‘module B6’ according to EN15978), calculated ex-ante according to the national methodologies for asset design assessment, or as defined in the set of standards ISO 52000, expressed as kWh/m2 per year. A renovation is eligible when it meets either one of the following thresholds:428 ‘major renovation’ means the renovation of a building where: (a) the total cost of the renovation relating to the building envelope or the technical building systems is higher than 25 % of the value of the building, excluding the value of the land upon which the building is situated; or (b) more than 25 % of the surface of the building envelope undergoes renovation; Member States may choose to apply option (a) or (b) 429 The 30% improvement must result from an actual reduction in primary energy demand (i.e. reductions in net primary energy demand through renewable energy sources do not count), and can be achieved through a succession of measures within a maximum of 3 years 430 International Property Measurement Standards (IPMS): https://ipmsc.org/Lack of resistance to extreme weather events (including flooding), and lack of resilience of to future temperature increases in terms of internal comfort conditions (only for large buildings). Excessive water consumption due to inefficient water appliances. Landfill and/or incineration of construction and demolition waste that could be otherwise recycled/reused. Presence of asbestos and/or substances of very high concern in the building materials. The unprotected handling of building components that are likely to contain substances of concern (e.g. asbestos containing materials) and of any hazardous construction and demolition waste arising from the building renovation; Indirect damage to forest ecosystems due to the use of timber products originating form forests that are not sustainably managed (only for large buildings).All relevant new water appliances (shower solutions, mixer showers, shower outlets, taps, WC suites, WC bowls and flushing cisterns, urinal bowls and flushing cisterns, bathtubs) must be in the top 2 classes for water consumption of the EU Water Label.431At least 80% (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the EU waste list432) generated on the construction site must be prepared for re-use or sent for recycling or other material recovery, including backfilling operations that use waste to substitute other materials.4335.a - It is ensured that building components and materials do not contain asbestos nor substances of very high concern as identified on the basis of the “Authorisation List” of the REACH Regulation. 434 5.b - Before starting the renovation work, a building survey must be carried out in accordance with national legislation by a competent specialist with training in asbestos surveying and in identification of other materials containing substances431 (http://www.europeanwaterlabel.eu/) Outside the EU, relevant water appliances will need to meet the flow rates identified by the EU Water Label as threshold for the top 2 classes of water consumption.

Professional services are a necessary support and validation mechanism, especially for building renovation. The investment linked to the individual measure(s) must be aimed at improving energy performance and/or reduction of carbon emissions. The motivation can be demonstrated through an energy audit, an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) or any other transparent and proportionate method acceptable by the Sustainable Finance Platform.There are no defined metrics across the individual measures and professional services. The following individual measures are eligible if compliant with minimum requirements set for individual components and systems in the applicable national regulations transposing the Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD), and must meet Ecodesign requirements pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC: a) Addition of insulation to the existing envelope components, such as external walls, roofs (including green roofs), lofts, basements and ground floors (including measures to ensure air-tightness, measures to reduce the effects of thermal bridges and scaffolding) and products for the application of the insulation to the building envelope (mechanical fixings, adhesive, etc.). b) Replacement of existing windows with new energy efficient windows. c) Replacement of existing external doors with new energy efficient doors. d) Installation and replacement of HVAC and domestic hot water systems, including equipment related to district heating service. e) Replacement of inefficient boiler or stove with highly efficient condensing boiler. The following individual measures are eligible if specific requirements are met: f)m) Installation of façade and roofing elements with a solar shading or solar control function, including those that support the growing of vegetation. The following individual measures are eligible if installed on-site as building services: n) Installation of solar photovoltaic systems (and the ancillary technical equipment). o) Installation of solar hot water panels (and the ancillary technical equipment). p) Installation and upgrade of heat pumps contributing to the targets for renewable energy in heating and cooling in accordance with Directive 2018/2001/EU (and the ancillary technical equipment). q) Installation of wind turbines (and the ancillary technical equipment). r)u) Installation of heat exchanger/recovery systems. The following professional services are eligible: v) Technical consultations (energy consultants, energy simulation, project management, production of EPC, dedicated training, etc.) linked to the individual measures mentioned above. w) Accredited energy audits and building performance assessments. x) Energy Management Services. y) Energy Performance Contracts. z) Energy Services provided by Energy Service Companies (ESCOs)Rationale Individual measures and professional services have been included as enabling activities contributing to the improvement of the energy performance and the decarbonisation of the buildings 384Excessive water consumption due to inefficient water appliances. The handling of building components that are likely to contain substances of concern (e.g. asbestos containing materials) and of any hazardous construction and demolition waste arising from the building renovation; Ensuring the future possibility of reusing and recycling building component and materials through careful selection of components/materials that prioritises recyclable materials and avoids hazardous substances.5.a - It is ensured that building components and materials do not contain asbestos nor substances of very high concern as identified on the basis of the “Authorisation List” of the REACH Regulation. 436 5.b - In case of addition of thermal insulation to the existing building envelope: a building survey must be carried out in accordance with national legislation by a competent specialist with training in asbestos surveying and in identification of other materials containing substances of concern. Any stripping of lagging that contains or is likely to contain asbestos, breaking or mechanical drilling or screwing and/or removal of insulation board, tiles and other asbestos containing materials shall be carried out by appropriately trained personnel, with health monitoring before, during and after the works, in accordance with national legislation.The acquisition of buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbon emissions throughout the lifecycle instead of lower-performing ones can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation objectives. While specific data on embodied carbon and thus carbon emissions from the full lifecycle is still limited and needs to be further generated, the acquisition of buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbon emissions during the use phase can already make an important contribution by directing users towards high-performing properties and by sending signals to markets about the need to lift the overall energy performance of the whole stock. For large non-residential buildings (i.e. buildings with an effective rated output for heating systems or systems for combined space heating and ventilation of over 290 kW, or buildings with floor area437 over 1000 m2), an additional requirement is introduced to ensure that these buildings are operated efficiently, and that actual energy and carbon savings are delivered each year. Condition for non-eligibility: to avoid lock-in and undermining the climate mitigation objective, the acquisition and ownership of buildings for the purpose of extraction, storage, transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels are not eligible. Use of alternative schemes as proxies: outside EU Member States, established schemes such as ‘green building’ certifications or building regulations may be used as alternative proof of eligibility, provided that this is verified by the Sustainable Finance Platform. The organisation responsible for the scheme will be able to apply for official recognition of its scheme by presenting evidence that a specific level of certification/regulation can be considered equivalent (or superior) to the taxonomy mitigation and DNSH threshold established for the relevant climatic zone and building type. The Sustainable Finance Platform will assess the evidence and approve or reject the application.The metric is Primary Energy Demand (PED): the annual primary energy demand associated with regulated energy use during the operational phase of the building life-cycle (i.e. ‘module B6’ according to EN15978), calculated ex-ante according tocreating demand for such buildings; this in turn will stimulate owners to build and renovate buildings to a higher level of performance than they would have done otherwise. sending a clear signal to the market that the acquisition of such buildings against an ever more stringent legislative background and changing client preferences can help reduce future potential risk and value depreciation.Lack of resistance to extreme weather events (including flooding), and lack of resilience of to future temperature increases in terms of internal comfort conditions. Excessive water consumption due to inefficient water appliances. Presence of asbestos and/or substances of very high concern in the building materials. Presence of hazardous contaminants in the soil of the building site. Inappropriate building location: impacts on ecosystems if built on greenfield and especially if in a conservation area or high biodiversity value area.6.a – The building must not be built on protected natural areas, such as land designated as Natura 2000, UNESCO World Heritage and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), or equivalent outside the EU as defined by UNESCO and / or the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) under the following categories: The economic activity integrates physical and non-physical measures aimed at reducing - to the extent possible and on a best effort basis all material physical climate risks to that activity, which have been identified through a risk assessment.The economic activity and its adaptation measures do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts of other people, nature and assets. The economic activity and its adaptation measures do not increase the risks of an adverse climate impact on other people, nature and 391Adaptation results can be monitored and measured against defined indicators. Recognising that risk evolves over time, updated assessments of physical climate risks should be undertaken at the appropriate frequency where possible.The economic activity reduces material physical climate risk in other economic activities and/or addresses systemic barriers to adaptation. Activities enabling adaptation include, but are not limited to, activities that:The economic activity reduces or facilitates adaptation to physical climate risks beyond the boundaries of the activity itself. The activity will need to demonstrate how it supports adaptation of others through:  an assessment of the risks resulting from both current weather variability and future climate change, including uncertainty, that the economic activity will contribute to address based on robust climate data;They allow for testing of the adaptation taxonomy approach in natural resource-based sectors (agriculture and water), service sectors (ICT and professional services) and asset-based sectors (electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply).Not all of the activities selected are included in the Taxonomy at this stage, subject to further technical work. In particular, two activities, Research and development (natural sciences and engineering) and Provision of specialised telecommunications applications for weather monitoring and forecast, are considered to have the potential to make a substantial contribution to climate change adaptation and therefore a full evaluation of their environmental impacts should be prioritised. The activities are as follows: Activities included in the Taxonomy with additional guidance440 EEA Report No 15/2017, “Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in Europe” (2017). 441 Based on EUROSTAT data available at https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/news/themes-in-the-spotlight/gva-employmentThis additional information covers the typical climate-related hazards that those activities tend to be sensitive to, and adaptation measures that may be taken to address those sensitivities. This is based on experience drawn from industry practice and existing sensitivity matrices used by development finance institutions. This additional information is provided simply as a starting point by users to assist in identifying physical climate risks to an activity and measures to address those risks. But it does not take the place of a context specific risk assessment given that relevant climate-related hazards and required adaptation measures will be location and context specific and will be identified through the application of the qualitative screening criteria described below.Afforestation Afforestation is defined as the establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land that, until then, was under a different land use, implies a transformation of land use from non-forest to forest442.Users of the Taxonomy should identify and explain which criteria they are responding to. Non-exhaustive list of examples of measures that can contribute to Adaptation of Forestry activities: The activity itself can be made climate-resilient through different measures, such as:  Use of early warning systems or wildfire control measures (to reduce damages due to wildfires enhanced by heat waves); Use of regeneration material (species and ecotypes) less sensitive to strong wind or timely management of seedling stand and timely thinning (to reduce damage to forest stands from increased wind);Use of species and ecotypes less susceptible to drought or diversification of species and ecotypes (to minimise tree losses due to lack of water availability). Do no significant harm assessment Key environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows:   ensure the long term ability of the forests to sequester carbon; impact on water resources as well as on water quality; pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertilizer;Forests are an unusual economic sector in which they provide a substantial carbon sink, and that significant harm for forest climate change mitigation include where an (adaptation) activity leads to a significant long-term reduction of the carbon sink. It is therefore important to maintain the forest area and thus forest carbon stocks and sink potential over the long-term. The principles for ensuring mitigation proofed adaptation activities are that adaptation responses should:  Adaptation responses shall comply with the requirement set out in Article 29(7)b of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (EU/2018/2001) which determines the requirement for management systems to be in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, or strengthened over the long term .Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

It implies no change of land use, includes planting/seeding of temporarily un-stocked forest areas as well as planting/seeding of areas with forest cover. It includes coppice from trees that were originally planted or seeded448. The FAO FRA definition of reforestation excludes natural regeneration. However, the Taxonomy recognises the importance of natural regeneration to the increased carbon sink and stock potential provided by forests in general. It is therefore included explicitly within this context in line with the FAO FRA definition of naturally regenerating forest 449. In the context of the Taxonomy, the category ‘reforestation’ applies in cases following extreme events (wind throws, fires etc.), and not as part of normal, legally binding obligation to reforest after harvesting.Users of the Taxonomy should identify and explain which criteria they are responding to.

SFM is further defined by Forest Europe as: 'sustainable forest management' means using forests and forest land in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems 452.Users of the Taxonomy should identify and explain which criteria they are responding to Non-exhaustive list of examples of measures that can contribute to Adaptation of Forestry activities: The activity itself can be made climate-resilient through different measures, such as:  Use of early warning systems or wildfire control measures (to reduce damages due to wildfires enhanced by heat waves); Use of regeneration material (species and ecotypes) less sensitive to strong wind or timely management of seedling stand and timely thinning (to reduce damage to forest stands from increased wind);Use of species and ecotypes less susceptible to drought or diversification of species and ecotypes (to minimise tree losses due to lack of water availability).

Exclusion of refuse derived fuels for cement production. Coincineration of waste has significant impacts on health and the environment due to the polluting nature of the associated emissions, and higher emissions ceiling for cement plants in comparison with dedicated waste incineration plants. Furthermore, promoting waste as eligible fuel source may undermine waste minimisation efforts in other sectors.Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with the EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment (2014/52/EU) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (2001/42/EC) (or other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks) – whichever is stricter - in the case of sites/operations in non-EU countries) for the site/operation (including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations, waste disposal facilities, etc.) and any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/ecosystems, particularly UNESCO World Heritage and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), have been implemented.For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (COM (2011) 244), the Birds (2009/147/EC) and Habitats (92/43/EEC) Directives (or other equivalent national provisions or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – whichever is stricter - in case of sites/operations in non-EU 431all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats; and a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented.Users of the Taxonomy should identify and explain which criteria they are responding to Do no significant harm assessment The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the manufacture of aluminium is associated with:  Climate mitigation the potential for significant air emission impacts: perfluorocarbons, fluoride gases, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and particulate matter (e.g. unused cryolite). Hydrogen fluorides can be toxic to vegetation; the toxic, corrosive and reactive nature of waste generated by the used linings (cathodes) from the electrolytic cells (known as spent pot lining (SPL)). Dissolved fluorides and cyanides from the SPL material can create significant environmental impacts including groundwater contamination and pollution of local watercourses; the ability (or lacking thereof) of aluminium manufacturing plants to incorporate aluminium scrap (including scrap from their own manufacturing processes) in the production process; and the potential to impact ecosystems as a result of the land footprint of the site and from polluting emissions.GHG Emissions from manufacturing economic activities that are either (1) proven to be aligned with an internationally recognised method for determining low carbon transition pathway or (2) that are lower than the average global emissions (based on emission performance standard determined by internationally recognised data) for that economic activity. The purpose of this approach is to ensure that there is a strong signal to the manufacturing sector to ambitiously improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions.In order to avoid risks to circular economy, aluminium manufacturing plants need to be able to process aluminium scrap. In order to avoid unnecessary resource and energy consumption, the aluminium scrap collection and sorting activities should be optimised for separation on an alloy specific basis. If scrap alloys are mixed, the functionality of the recycled material is restricted, and valuable alloying elements may be lost.

Do no significant harm assessment The main potential for significant harm to the other environmental objectives associated with the renovation of existing buildings is determined by:     Excessive energy consumption and operational carbon emissions. Excessive water consumption due to inefficient water appliances. Landfill and/or incineration of construction and demolition waste that could be otherwise recycled/reused. Presence of asbestos and/or substances of very high concern in the building materials. The unprotected handling of building components that are likely to contain substances of concern (e.g. asbestos containing materials) and of any hazardous construction and demolition waste arising from the building renovation; Indirect damage to forest ecosystems due to the use of timber products originating form forests that are not sustainably managed (only for large buildings).The measures adopted to improve the resilience of the building must not increase the rates of operational carbon emissions of the building. Exceptions are allowed if it can be demonstrated that increase in emissions is necessary to carry out the measures, and there is a positive trade-off. To avoid lock-in and undermining the climate mitigation objective, the construction of new buildings designed for the purpose of extraction, storage, transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels is not eligible for the Taxonomy.At least 80% (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the EU waste list592) generated on the construction site must be prepared for re-use or sent for recycling or other material recovery, including backfilling operations that use waste to substitute other materials.5935.a - It is ensured that building components and materials do not contain asbestos nor substances of very high concern as identified on the basis of the “Authorisation List” of the REACH Regulation. 594 5.b - Before starting the renovation work, a building survey must be carried out in accordance with national legislation by a competent specialist with training in asbestos surveying and in identification of other materials containing substances of concern. Any stripping of lagging that contains or is likely to contain asbestos, breaking or mechanical drilling or screwing and/or removal of insulation board, tiles and other asbestos containing materials shall be carried out by appropriately trained personnel, with health monitoring before, during and after the works, in accordance with national legislation.If the renovation project covers more than 1000 m2 of floor area (over one or more buildings): at least 80% of all timber products used in the renovation for structures, cladding and finishes must have been either recycled/reused or sourced from sustainably managed forests as certified by third-party certification audits performed by accredited certification bodies, e.g. FSC/PEFC standards or equivalent.595591 (http://www.europeanwaterlabel.eu/) Outside the EU, relevant water appliances will need to meet the flow rates identified by the EU Water Label as threshold for the top 2 classes of water consumption.

Globally, the ‘catastrophe protection gap’ - what should be insured but is not – reached US$280 billion (EUR€252 billion) in 2018596. The TEG is concerned to address the widening protection gap by classifying selected non-life insurance lines of business (LOBs) as substantially contributing to ‘adaptation by’. The eligible economic activity substantially contributes to ‘adaptation by’ when it meets Principle B1.1 whereby: “the activity reduces or facilitates adaptation to physical climate risks beyond the boundaries of the activity itself. This includes activities that: a) Promote a new technology, product, practice or governance process or innovative uses of existing practices (including those related to natural infrastructure); or, b) Remove information, financial, technological and capacity barriers to adaptation by others.” Non-life insurance eligible for the Taxonomy includes selected LOBs and insurance products and services that provide cover for climate-related hazards to activities and/or assets that are Taxonomy aligned. As the number and range of sub-sectors eligible for the Taxonomy evolves arising from development of substantial contribution to the remaining four environmental objectives, additional activities will become eligible for Taxonomy aligned non-life insurance products. Furthermore, the TEG believes that economic activities that may not be screened for substantial contribution to any of the six environmental objectives, such as environmentally neutral activities (schools, hospitals, public administration services, etc.), which may nonetheless be impacted by climate change should be considered as potentially eligible for Taxonomy aligned non-life insurance. TEG recommends further consideration of DNSH criteria for non-life insurance activities to enhance the coverage of activities and improve usability of the criteria.Such insurance represents an important element for climate change adaptation since it does not only support risk sharing but is also working throughout the risk management cycle (identify, analyse, plan, implement and evaluate) and the disaster management cycle (prevent and protect, prepare, respond and recover).Users of the Taxonomy should identify and explain which criteria they are responding to. Do no significant harm assessment The specific activity or activities being insured must meet the DNSH criteria for those activities. That is, the non-life insurer (i.e. the primary insurance product provider) is required to validate that the activity and/or asset being insured is compliant with the relevant DNSH thresholds for the activity under cover.COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2015/35 of 10 October 2014 supplementing Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) 598DIRECTIVE 2009/138/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) (recast). file:///C:/Europe%20Sustainable%20Finance%20Legislation/Solvency%20II_CELEX_32009L0138_EN_TXT.pdfoffering standard non-life insurance products against climate-related hazards; offering multi-peril (yield) crop insurance against both annual yield variations in addition to extreme climate-related hazards; incentivising adaptation behaviour, for example where insurers would offer premium discounts for homeowners who take steps to protect their houses from wildfires; offering risk engineering expertise to their customers with proactive risk improvement action management programs or by sharing their expertise with new projects; using insurers’ data and knowledge in developing zoning and building code regulations, standards and construction requirements and local adaptation plans. Insurers often have good information on which areas are at high risk and which measures can lower risk. This information is often used in designing zoning, flood defences, building code regulations and prioritising related adaptation investments; developing innovative risk transfer mechanisms as part of broader risk management solutions to help under-insured or uninsured communities to meet the challenges of a changing climate (for example the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility or the African Risk Capacity); requiring minimum building standards, or adherence to build-back-better principles, differentiated by risk level, as a standard element of insurance contracts; developing online tools or early warning methods to allow people to detect risks to property from floods, storms and other climate related hazards; helping improve natural catastrophe models for different climate-related hazards.Undertakings should follow specific requirements: i) be well capitalised (i.e. compliance with capital requirements, under Solvency II or equivalent regime); and (ii) demonstrate strong risk management (e.g. follow EIOPA’s Technical Advice on integration of sustainability risks).engineering design (i.e. applying physical laws and principles of engineering in the design of machines, materials, instruments, structures, processes and systems) and consulting activities for: machinery, industrial processes and industrial plant projects involving civil engineering, hydraulic engineering, traffic engineering water management projects projects elaboration and realisation relative to electrical and electronic engineering, mining engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical, industrial and systems engineering, safety engineering elaboration of projects using air conditioning, refrigeration, sanitary and pollution control engineering, acoustical engineering etc. geophysical, geologic and seismic surveying geodetic surveying activities: land and boundary surveying activities hydrologic surveying activities subsurface surveying activities cartographic and spatial information activities.Users of the Taxonomy should identify and explain which criteria they are responding to. Do no significant harm assessment The specific activity or activities which are the subject of the engineering or related consultancy service must meet the DNSH criteria for those activities.Engineering activities associated with design, construction, retrofitting and reconstruction of infrastructure to enhance resilience to the climaterelated hazards, through the implementation of the structural adaptation measures or ecosystem based approaches, contribute to the reduction of physical climate risk of other economic activities.Consulting and planning activities related to engineering activities that take into account climate-related hazards and enable adaptation of the built infrastructure (e.g. building codes; integrated management systems; delivering spatial information on changing risks and vulnerabilities due to CC) contribute to the reduction of physical climate risk of other economic activitiesThey allow for testing of the adaptation taxonomy approach in natural resource-based sectors (agriculture and water), service sectors (ICT and professional services) and asset-based sectors (electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply).Not all of the activities selected are included in the Taxonomy at this stage, subject to further technical work. In particular, two activities, Research and development (natural sciences and engineering) and Provision of specialised telecommunications applications for weather monitoring and forecast, are considered to have the potential to make a substantial contribution to climate change adaptation and therefore a full evaluation of their environmental impacts should be prioritised. The activities are as follows: Activities included in the Taxonomy with additional guidance (see earlier sections).600 EEA Report No 15/2017, “Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in Europe” (2017). 601 Based on EUROSTAT data available at https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/news/themes-in-the-spotlight/gva-employmentAdditional information is provided on the typical climate-related hazards that those activities tend to be sensitive to, and adaptation measures that may be taken to address those sensitivities. This is based on experience drawn from industry practice and existing sensitivity matrices used by development finance institutions. This additional information is provided simply as a starting point by users to assist in identifying physical climate risks to an activity and measures to address those risks. But it does not take the place of a context specific risk assessment given that relevant climate-related hazards and required adaptation measures will be location and context specific and will be identified through the application of the qualitative screening criteria described below.This group comprises basic research, applied research, experimental development in natural sciences and engineering dedicated to adaptation to climate change. See example contributions for further examples.Users of the Taxonomy should identify and explain which criteria they are responding to.

Do no significant harm assessment The DNSH assessment for this activity has not been fully completed. The TEG recommends that the Platform develops DNSH criteria for this activity as a matter of priority.The provision of specialised telecommunications applications for weather monitoring, forecast and early warning improves preparedness and response planning for small-scale and large-scale drought, floods, cyclones, storm surges, and other climate-related hazards, and reduce the risk of death, injury, asset loss and damage. By providing and delivering climate-related information to authorities and the general public, specialised telecommunications applications for weather monitoring, forecast and early warning empowers individuals, institutions and public and private organisations to adapt.nowcast, short, medium and extended range, forecast of drought, flood, tropical cyclone, wind storms, hot spells, cold spells, and other climate-related hazards; public weather local forecast; long range forecast; early warnings related to climate-related hazards; sea and coastal zone forecasts; and customized sector-based forecasts.
